This is just a summary of the points I took from the Lean conference at Bletchley. &nbsp;They all need expanding, this is just the stuff that struck me that I want to record.<div><br /><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">A Kanban Multiverse – Karl Scotland</span><br /><b>Points from his talk</b><br /><ul><li>Meaning = visualise; interact; persist</li><li>Kanban provides the translation between communities</li><li>Remove columns from the Kanban board - no more chucking things over the wall to people</li><li>Flip charts for design models</li><li>Dots on cards for every day in dev, crosses for every day in test</li><li>Exploration of UI is part of the card</li></ul><b>Ideas applicable for my project</b><br /><ul><li>Add broken acceptance tests to the Kanban Board?</li><li>Start doing task breakdowns again</li><li>Add issues and impediments to Kanban board?</li><li>Mingle should be updated to reflect the Kanban, at the moment the states are incorrect</li></ul><div><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Converting a Scrum Team to Kanban - Mattias Skarin</span></div></div><div><b>Points from his talk</b><br /><ul><li>Moved from releases per iterations to releases per week</li><li>Shifted motivation from delivering at end of iteration towards delivering quality</li><li>Establish release cadence and team rhythm</li><li>Root cause analysis to find problems and target them</li><li>Removed the need for estimates</li></ul><b>Ideas applicable for my project</b><br /><ul><li>Shift to focus on release cadence from iterations?</li></ul><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>Product Development in the Land of the Free</span><br /><b>Points from their talk</b><br /><ul><li>Goal should be to “Delight Customers”</li><li>Sitting together decreases waste</li><li>Sysadmins belong to the team and rotate</li><li>Deliver value fast enough and you don't have to ask for permission</li></ul><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>Learn to Lean: Becoming a Lean Startup – Damon Morgan</span><br /><b>Points from his talk</b><br /><ul><li>Introduce a learning culture: blogs, brown bags, conferences</li><li>Scrum introduces a half-day overhead of planning etc.</li><li>Scrum implies a handed off release to QA / Ops</li><li>Didn't have “QA” but “Developer/Testers” and “Tester/Developers”</li><li>Lean = planning on demand.&nbsp;</li><li>Not sure when we're supposed to do retrospectives with a pull model?</li><li>Definition of Done is not only released to production, but has two&nbsp;possibilities: Generating Value and Not Generating Value</li><li>Cards that are “complete” but not released are inventory (and therefore waste)</li><li>Need fast smoke tests</li><li>Monitoring allows you to reduce errors and see if the release was good.
