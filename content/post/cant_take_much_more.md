Inspired by <a href="http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/7/24/your-app-makes-me-fat">Your App Makes Me Fat</a>, I was going to write a blog post about decision fatigue. &nbsp;It's a topic very close to my heart right now as I try to plan for my <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/trishas-world-tour-2013.html">upcoming speaking engagements,</a>&nbsp;continue working on the new Java driver, try to finish the last couple of blogs on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/spock/">Spock</a>, and last but not least plan for moving home this week.<br /><br />But since my cognitive resources are at a low point right now, I'll just leave you with a gif instead:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i.minus.com/ibaDjk7AeIcvxv.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://i.minus.com/ibaDjk7AeIcvxv.gif" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">What programming is like</td></tr></tbody></table><br />
