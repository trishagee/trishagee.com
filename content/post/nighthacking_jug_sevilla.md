Last Saturday Mr Stephen Chin came to Sevilla on his crazy European tour to show us Lego and Robots.  This was our largest turnout yet 
for a Java User Group event in Sevilla, which surprised me as it was on a weekend, and the weekend before the spectacle that is [Semana 
Santa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week_in_Seville) [in Sevilla](http://youtu.be/I5rnDZGNJW8).

This is also the first event that we've had videoed (apologies for the horrible focus at times on the video, 
I'm just learning and used to relying heavily on auto-focus).

Thanks very much to Stephen for visiting, and thank you to those who came, you're making me re-think the idea of running events at 
weekends.

Por primera vez, un evento del Grupo Usario de Java en Sevilla es en video. Lo siento por la calidad de foco de la camara, 
soy una principiante.
