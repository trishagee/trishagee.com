I&nbsp;have not (yet) seen the presentation <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2009/05/01/On+Speaking+Trolling+Inciting+And+Growing.aspx">this post </a>is referring to.&nbsp; But I think many of the comments Ted makes are very valid, and our industry as a whole should occasionally stop and think.&nbsp; I've seen Ted speak at QCon, and I've had a lot of time for his comments ever since.<br /><br />I'm aware that this blog is rapidly filling with comments about gender and perceptions and people-y stuff, when I originally wanted it to be a purely technical blog.&nbsp; But I guess this other stuff interests me more. &nbsp;And there are less people talking about it than there are talking about pure technical solutions to problems.<br /><br />
