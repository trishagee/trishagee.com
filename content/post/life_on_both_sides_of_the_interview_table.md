InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. &nbsp;Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. &nbsp;We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what's going through the interviewer's mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/job-interview-tips#.UiBS9_WZJyU.blogger">Hire Education - Making Interviews Rock</a></div><br />It's kind of funny because we talk a lot about hiring at ThoughtWorks (where we both worked, and which has one of the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hardest-tech-company-job-interviews-2012-8">toughest interview processes</a> in the industry) and LMAX, which learnt a lot off ThoughtWorks and shaped its own process for a smaller company that has different goals. &nbsp;Yet neither of us work at those places now. &nbsp;Still, we share stories from many of the places we've worked (or chose not to work), and if there's one take-home point, it's that hiring (and being hired) is not a simple thing to do well.
