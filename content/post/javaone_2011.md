So, I'm off to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne</a> next week!<br /><br />This is an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. &nbsp;I'll be there with <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/">Martin</a> (of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/">Disruptor</a> fame), and <a href="http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/">Martijn</a> (that's not going to get confusing at all). &nbsp;Martin will be talking about the Disruptor on Thursday, and Martijn is busy talking about... everything. &nbsp;Most importantly for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/">LJC</a> he's representing us in our <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/05/london-java-community-elected-to-jcp.html">shiny new JCP Executive Committee</a> role.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to meeting pretty much anyone and everyone who'll talk to me. &nbsp;It's the first international conference I've been to and I'm hoping to meet people I wouldn't normally get a chance to see in London. &nbsp;It's also really cool to be able to represent both <a href="http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/">LMAX</a> and the London Java Community. Hopefully it won't lead to some sort of split personality syndrome.<br /><br />Almost more excitingly, I'll be doing a spot of shopping in New York on the way there and back. Because, well, it would be rude to fly over to the States and not drop in on my old home.<br /><br />Maybe I'll get a chance to catch up with some of you in one of those amazing cities...?
