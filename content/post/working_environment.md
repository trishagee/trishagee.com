How important to you is your working environment? <br /><br />&nbsp;- Type of desk <br />&nbsp;- What's on it <br />&nbsp;- Position / type of mouse, keyboard, monitor(s) <br />&nbsp;- Music / background sound (or lack of it) <br />&nbsp;- Open plan vs team room vs cube vs personal office <br />&nbsp;- etc... <br /><br />These physical items could be extended to include your virtual environment: <br />&nbsp;- Eclipse / IntelliJ Idea / Visual Studio (is it still called this?) / other dev enviornment - setup, preferences, window positions <br />&nbsp;- OS <br />&nbsp;- Desktop icons - do you care what / how many / positioning <br />&nbsp;- Which software is always open when you're working, and does it matter what order you open them in (so they're in the correct place on your task bar) (additional: does not having enough RAM&nbsp;cripple you because you have to constantly shut and re-open software?) <br /><br />How anal are you about setting these things up and getting them <em>just right</em> before you can start coding (or whatever it is you do)? <br /><br />This post comes to you courtesy of my irritation with my chair.&nbsp; I&nbsp;want to code cross-legged today and my chair does not adjust in the dimension required to provide me with enough space to do this.
