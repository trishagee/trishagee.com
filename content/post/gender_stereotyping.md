<br />I'm very interested in the subject of gender stereotyping, which probably isn't surprising as I'm a girl in a predominantly male industry.&nbsp; And I&nbsp;like cars, and&nbsp;sports, and get irritated if people assume I'm not &quot;allowed&quot; to be interested in these things.<br /><br />Far from being discriminated against, however, I&nbsp;find many people ask me why there aren't more women in the industry and what can be done to encourage girls into IT.&nbsp; If these questions were easy to answer, they wouldn't have to be asked.<br /><br />But one of my personal theories is around how we raise our children.&nbsp; Yes, it's possible that girls are genetically, for some reason, averse to technical types of roles. &nbsp;Or&nbsp;that the working environments don't appeal to the feminine mindset.&nbsp; But if you tell kids from an early age that some things are for boys and some are for girls, there just aren't going to be enough girls studying &quot;boys&quot; subjects later in life to get a large proportion of them into &quot;boys&quot; jobs.<br /><br />I have a lot more to say around all these possibilities but I only want to explore one small area today.&nbsp; I was pointed this morning to an article on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/dec/16/play">Gender and Toys</a>.&nbsp; I'm mainly recording it in here so I don't forget where it is.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;found it interesting because it raises many of the same questions I&nbsp;have, and answers almost none of them.&nbsp; At this stage, I think it's very difficult to say how much of a child's preferences are there because of parental or peer pressure, and how much is natural.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&nbsp;don't understand why a society can discourage the use of words like chairman (preferring &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;chairperson&quot;) and that works hard to at least look like they promote equal opportunities in the workplace, can encourage gender-specific advertising to children (have you watched the adverts between cartoons?) and the <span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">blatant </span>gender stereotyping the article talks about in toy stores.<br /><br />The main point to take out of it, I&nbsp;think, is that we should be aware of how we raise our children.&nbsp; Well OK&nbsp;so any parent will always want the best for the child and so that's a slightly fatuous statement.&nbsp; What I&nbsp;mean is, I don't think we should inflict our own preconceptions of what a child will like based purely upon their gender, or they might grow up thinking that really is what they like.&nbsp; We should be allowed to develop our own preferences and exercise any skills that interest us until we find what really suits us personally.<br /><br /><br />PS The assumption that Lego is for boys in that article made me very angry.&nbsp; Of all toys I&nbsp;thought Lego was pretty good at not overtly targeting an audience, although the new trend towards Lego-for-girls has worried me since first saw it.&nbsp; Lego is for kids!&nbsp; Doesn't matter what age or gender they are!&lt;/rant&gt;
