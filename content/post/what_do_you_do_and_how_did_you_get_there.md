So <a href="http://careers.grad-dc.co.uk/2012/05/18/107/">yet another interview</a> with me is available, but this one is in written form. &nbsp;It's for the Graduate Developer Community, the aim is to show undergraduates and graduates what real techies jobs are like, and how people doing them they got there.<br /><br />It's long, but if you know anyone just starting out their career who wants to get a feel for where they might want to go, please point them at it. &nbsp;The site has a number of interviews with people in different roles so it's quite a good way to showcase the diversity of what's available.
