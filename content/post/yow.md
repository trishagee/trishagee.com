December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. &nbsp;It's hard to believe that it's the eve of Christmas Eve already, it's almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you're getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. &nbsp;A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PWSc0RE99iQ/UrhWxezIRSI/AAAAAAAAMB8/wQSmg4lwVl8/s1600/Cliff.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PWSc0RE99iQ/UrhWxezIRSI/AAAAAAAAMB8/wQSmg4lwVl8/s400/Cliff.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I cannot take Christmas seriously in this weather</td></tr></tbody></table><a href="http://yowconference.com.au/">YOW!</a>&nbsp;is a unique conference, in that it's the same agenda in three different cities: Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney. &nbsp;It seems to me that this is a great way to attract speakers from a long way away (and <i>everywhere</i> is a long way away from Australia) but make it cost effective - although you have to shuttle the speakers between the cities, you have the speakers for nearly two weeks and get the material three times in the three different locations.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bVUihtZxvfY/UrhXL-fc8cI/AAAAAAAAMCE/J9RjMWAhOjY/s1600/1Coogee.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bVUihtZxvfY/UrhXL-fc8cI/AAAAAAAAMCE/J9RjMWAhOjY/s400/1Coogee.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I suffered a lot for this conference...</td></tr></tbody></table>As a speaker, it's awesome - not only do you spend the better part of the month in the sun when your hemisphere is nearing mid-winter, but you also have the opportunity to really get to know the other speakers - you're sharing bus journeys, flights and dinners together for a week and a half. &nbsp;Also, because you're at the same conference three times, you have the chance to see a lot more of the talks. &nbsp;I admit I missed most of them in Melbourne because I was re-writing and practicing both my talks (note to self - next time, only commit to one talk), but by Sydney I saw the talks that I wouldn't normally get around to - talks on technologies I'm not currently using and probably won't get a chance to. &nbsp;But it was great to see other approaches to problems, and the variety of presentation styles.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xSTWWRVPSqA/UrhXgAkENRI/AAAAAAAAMCM/7wR39QH1mWI/s1600/1Sydney+night.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xSTWWRVPSqA/UrhXgAkENRI/AAAAAAAAMCM/7wR39QH1mWI/s400/1Sydney+night.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Since I saw most of the talks, I thought I'd give a run down of those I watched (now I feel bad I didn't get a chance to see everyone's, if I missed you it's not because I don't love you):<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef9f36950e81dc55000027?track=Keynote&amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au">Computing Like the Brain: The Path to Machine Intelligence</a><br /><div>Jeff Hawkins (<a href="http://twitter.com/numenta">@numenta</a>)</div><div><br /></div><div>I've seen Jeff talk on this subject twice before -
