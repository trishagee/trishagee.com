As an associate member of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/">London Java Community</a> (LJC), I'm very pleased with the news that we won an Open seat on the Java SE/EE executive committee. &nbsp;<a href="http://jcp.org/en/whatsnew/elections">The results</a> show that we got an astonishing 47.5% of the vote - if an MP got voted in with that percentage the newspapers would probably be using the word "landslide".<br /><br />It's quite exciting to be one of the two user groups involved. &nbsp;We hope to balance some of the larger corporate organisations, we're the voice of real life Java developers who use the language every day, for enterprise development or open source projects.<br /><br />You can argue Java is dying, but the community is not. &nbsp;And I think we're exactly the people to guide its future.<br /><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">PS (Warning: gratuitous plug incoming) If you're at all Java-curious and you like drinking and attempting to be social, join us this Tuesday for our monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/16360581/">Developer Sessions</a> at the Porterhouse in Covent Garden.</span>
