Today, I found my own blog useful.&nbsp; I was configuring Spring validation on my new project, and had to <a href="http://mechanitis.livejournal.com/7127.html">remind myself how to do it</a>.&nbsp; We configured validation on the new project in less than an hour, which beats the two days it took me to work out how to do it the first time.<br /><br />And I impressed one of my new work collegues.&nbsp; Apparently I&nbsp;am now the Spring Guru.&nbsp; Oooops.<br /><br />
