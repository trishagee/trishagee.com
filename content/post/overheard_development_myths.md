Continuing the theme of Things I Have Heard I Don't Think I Agree With.<br /><br /><b>To developers technologies are everything</b><br />I can't remember the context of this but I hear the same sentiment in different guises over and over again. &nbsp;Often from non-techies, but more alarmingly from developers.<br /><br />Is this true?<br /><br />It's true for a certain tribe of techies, sure. &nbsp;And creating and effectively using new technologies is an important part of what drives the current information age forward. &nbsp;But I'd be worried if I thought that 99% of developers were like this.<br /><br />In our day jobs, and also if we want to create something that makes any money, we need to be interested in solving people's problems and creating solutions. &nbsp;Sure, we'll use technology to do that. &nbsp;But if we were all only motivated by technology, we'd always be trying out the Next Big Thing when our customers wanted a simple CRUD web app. &nbsp;Any organisation that encouraged this sort of technology um, infidelity? &nbsp;playing the field? might find themselves with lots of fascinated and broadly-educated developers, but not a lot of productivity.<br /><br />I always thought developers were drawn by wrestling with the machine to solve a particular problem, or to do something that hadn't been done before. &nbsp;I didn't think we liked learning Ruby because we didn't study it at university, or switching to a functional language simply because that's the way the whole world is going.<br /><br /><b>We can train The Business to speak our language</b><br />I've heard a number of people talking about the Holy Grail of having business owners write acceptance tests. &nbsp;At <a href="http://www.lmax.com/">LMAX</a> we have a (Java-based) DSL that theoretically could allow technical-ish non-developers to write our automated acceptance tests. &nbsp;However, is this the right thing to do? &nbsp;To make our jobs easier, and our code better quality, we need the business to become almost developers?<br /><br />Our (very difficult) job as developers is to act as translator between the ones and zeros a computer speaks and the real life doman language our business guys (and girls) use. &nbsp;Forcing the business to become more technical is just, well, lazy.<br /><br />So if our business people shouldn't be forced to become more technical, how can we bridge the gap? &nbsp;Is there anything that we as developers can do to move closer to the business?<br /><br />A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321125215">Ubiquitous Language</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321125215" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />&nbsp;is a good start. &nbsp;When a business user talks about an order, a developer should be thinking about the Order class, or something that implements an Order interface. &nbsp;When the business talks about placing an order, a developer shouldn't be thinking "place order translates into the execute method", they should assume there's a placeOrder method somewhere they can use as a start point.<br /><br />We certainly shouldn't be training the head of sales to start talking in terms of Java classes or technologies - "I want the Resin tier to validate the order while the OrderMatcherImpl checks for availability". &nbsp;That would be silly.<br /><br />Development is hard, that's why they pay us. &nbsp;And part of that hard job is learning the business model we're implementing so we can mirror and support the business. &nbsp;We shouldn't be inflicting our technology on the business.
