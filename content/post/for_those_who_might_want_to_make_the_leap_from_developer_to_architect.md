The last two weeks, actual work has conspired to keep me away from the blog. How rude. I miss "the beach" already.<br /><br />It seems only fair to summarise the lessons I have learnt whilst masquerading as an architect on a short consulting stint with <a href="http://www.dancingmango.com/blog/">Marc McNeill</a>. &nbsp;Simon Brown at <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/">Coding the Architecture</a> is much better at talking about this stuff than I am, but I need to update the blog with something!<br /><br /><b>1. Ask dumb questions</b><br />Someone's called you in because they want your help, and presumably if their problem was simple they would have fixed it already. &nbsp;You're not there to know everything out of the box, you're there to find out what's going on and summarise it. That means asking questions, even the dumb ones. &nbsp;That's something I learnt off <a href="http://www.davefarley.net/">my previous boss</a>.<br /><br /><b>2. Draw lots of pretty pictures</b><br />As a developer, I like to think in code, I like to poke around it to find out what's going on. &nbsp;But if you want to get a feel for the bigger picture, not having access to the code, or even the&nbsp;documentation, could be better. &nbsp;It forces you to look beyond the detail. &nbsp;Sketch things out on the whiteboard to help get the picture of the domain and the systems in your head. <br /><br />Of course, there's always the worry that your pictures aren't the reality. &nbsp;That's why you need to...<br /><br /><b>3. Check your theories/pictures/numbers with everyone</b><br />In the first week of the engagement I made some assumptions based on the information I had gathered so far. &nbsp;Once I'd run those past the architects and developers really working on the code, I found they were only half the story. &nbsp;The feedback from those guys helped evolve the picture of the current state of play, and shaped the future direction.<br /><br /><b>4. Take notes</b><br />Especially of acronyms used and people's names and roles.<br /><br />This is probably more a "me" thing. &nbsp;My memory works as an index, so I need the detail somewhere - I can remember I wrote something about something, and where I wrote it, but I won't remember the details. &nbsp;I also find that simply writing things down helps to get it straight in my head. &nbsp;I probably didn't use 50% of my notes, but all that information was in my head.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><b>5. Buy your own whiteboard pens!</b><br />I've worked in a lot of places, as a consultant and a permanent employee. &nbsp;And one thing you can almost guarantee is that the pens in your meeting room will not work. &nbsp;Or they'll be permanent.<br /><br />I also bought a board rubber and spray cleaner, but that's probably my OCD....<br /><br /><br />At the end of an intense two weeks we had delivered:<br /><br /><ul><li>A picture of the existing architecture</li><li>Pictures of three phases of future architecture</li><li>An approximate roadmap for delivery</li><li>Guide estimates for the stories discovered</li><li>...and pages and pages of supporting diagrams and information.</li></ul><br /><br />The air in Les Alpes must've helped get the brain moving! &nbsp;Of course, I took my camera on my little jaunt to France.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-K4qsRxew0X4/TVma3mkCSmI/AAAAAAAAH-Q/IFeWDHl1W4U/s1600/DSC_0128.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-K4qsRxew0X4/TVma3mkCSmI/AAAAAAAAH-Q/IFeWDHl1W4U/s400/DSC_0128.JPG" width="400" /></a><br /><br />It was a great first role for me at ThoughtWorks. &nbsp;I worked my socks off and thoroughly enjoyed it.
