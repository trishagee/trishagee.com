I was flattered to be <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-disruptor">interviewed for InfoQ</a> at QCon London. &nbsp;It was a fun interview actually, and didn't feel anything like the half an hour it actually took. &nbsp;In it, I get to talk about Agile at LMAX, the Disruptor (of course) and diversity in IT (again).
