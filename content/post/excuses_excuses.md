Isn't a shame that actual day-to-day work always seems to get in the way of progress?&nbsp; How you're always too busy fire-fighting to actually perform the critical thing that might actually improve affairs.<br /><br />All this is basically a setup for a roundabout excuse for why this blog has been neglected so shortly after it was begun.&nbsp; I was a bit too busy doing the day job.<br /><br />Still, people like <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/joelonsoftware">Joel</a> and <a href="http://livejournal.com/usres/dilbert_blog">Scott</a> manage regular pronouncements and I'm sure they're much busier than I!<br />
