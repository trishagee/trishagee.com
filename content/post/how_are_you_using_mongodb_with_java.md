So, like one of my presentations, I have a question for you. &nbsp;Actually, I have more than one question for you. &nbsp;I'm not going to bother with survey monkey or whatever, I want to share the answers so please, answers in the comments:<br /><ol><li>Are you using the Java driver for MongoDB in your application?</li><li>Are you using the Java driver directly, or are you using a third party library like Morphia, Spring Data, the Scala driver, your own abstraction layer, etc?</li><li>If you're using a third party library, why did you choose that over using the Java driver directly?</li><li>If you're using the Java driver directly, what do you like about it?&nbsp;</li><li>If you're using the Java driver directly, are there any areas that give you pain? &nbsp;Areas for improvement?</li><li>Which version of Java are you using?</li></ol><div>Feel free to leave additional information if you have it. &nbsp;And this is a public blog, so if you're really mean I'll just delete your comment. &nbsp;So there.</div>
