Don't sell science, sell scientists and engineers". &nbsp;The point I took from that was that by focussing on "science" and "technology", we could be losing people - by showcasing the people, the talent, the passions, we are much more likely to engage children. &nbsp;And I think that stands for adults as well.</div><div><br /></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XzDZJM8QFHA/UG9H6aw8GGI/AAAAAAAALNY/A8iBGCFDGWQ/s1600/robots-and-people.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XzDZJM8QFHA/UG9H6aw8GGI/AAAAAAAALNY/A8iBGCFDGWQ/s320/robots-and-people.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center;">A robot!</td></tr></tbody></table><div>And this nicely fits the message I was trying to get across in my session on Wednesday (which I know I've <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/javaone-problem-with-women-technical.html">already blogged about</a>) - it's dead important to address the failure points when it comes to diversity, but I think we forget to push the positives - the reason we don't understand why some groups of people are under-represented in technology is because we all love being here, it's a great industry to work in. &nbsp;I'd love to see our passions more widely showcased than simply at conferences where we're a self-selecting audience.</div><div><br /></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bfal0DsvHx4/UG9HIvDYvLI/AAAAAAAALMY/ehlSr0SOVko/s1600/LJC.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bfal0DsvHx4/UG9HIvDYvLI/AAAAAAAALMY/ehlSr0SOVko/s400/LJC.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The LJC panel about our involvement in the Java Community Process</td></tr></tbody></table><div>Not only was this a great JavaOne for me personally, it was a real triumph for the <a href="http://www.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/">London Java Community</a>. &nbsp;Last year there were only two of us here, and Martijn was working hard to introduce me to the other JUG leaders and the people on the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/home/index">JCP</a> committee that we were going to be working with over the next 12 months. &nbsp;This year, there were five of us here, spreading the word about our work as a member of the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee">Executive Committee</a> of the Java Community Process (the Java standards body), primarily our <a href="http://adoptajsr.org/">Adopt a JSR</a> program. &nbsp;We also wanted to talk to a load of people about the <a href="http://java.net/projects/adoptopenjdk/pages/AdoptOpenJDK">Adopt OpenJDK</a> program as well, we've found lots of developers are really keen to develop the language itself, Java at the fundamental level, and we really want to help bridge the gap between the guys who work on the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a> project and the developers in the community. &nbsp;But all our hard work over the last year, kicking off these programs and working with other user groups and Oracle to really harness the power of the community, has been recognised. &nbsp;We've won not one, but two awards - woohoo!
