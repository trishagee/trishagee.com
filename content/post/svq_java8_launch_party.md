Last night at the Sevilla JUG we officially celebrated the launch of [Java 8](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/) - yay!

Don't be fooled by the picture, people had more fun than it looks.  Honest.

For anyone who missed the session, or who was there and wants access to the materials, here they are:

 - [The Main Presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/lambda-streams-java-8)
 - [Trisha's real-life lambda code](https://github.com/trishagee/happy-mappy) (the class we were looking at was `TweetDecorator`)
 - Finally, we used the [slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/SimonRitter/javase8-55thingsv2-sritter) of another of Simon's 
 presentations, [55 New Features in Java SE 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtAredKhyac)
 
Note that the last link is to a video from [vJUG](http://www.meetup.com/virtualJUG/), the Virtual Java User Group, 
which is a great source of presentations from international speakers.
