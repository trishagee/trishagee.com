I'm going to be in Dublin 1st-5th July. &nbsp;While I'm there, I thought I'd visit appropriate user groups if there are any. &nbsp;I can't see a JUG registered on the <a href="https://www.java.net/jug-profile-map">JUG Map</a>, but I was thinking a city like Dublin must have a few tech meetup groups.<br /><br />Any suggestions? &nbsp;Anyone out there and keen for me to gatecrash their party?
