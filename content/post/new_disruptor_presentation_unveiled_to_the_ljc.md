A few weeks ago, I presented my new "User's Guide to the Disruptor" talk to the <a href="http://londonjavacommunity.co.uk/">London Java Community</a>. &nbsp;Since it was very kindly hosted at Skillsmatter, there is a <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/the-disruptor/js-3798">video of the presentation</a> available, and the slides are below.<br /><br /><div style="width:425px" id="__ss_12091737"> <strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/a-users-guide-to-the-disruptor" title="Concurrent Programming Using the Disruptor" target="_blank">Concurrent Programming Using the Disruptor</a></strong> <iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/12091737" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> <div style="padding:5px 0 12px"> View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee" target="_blank">Trisha Gee</a> </div> </div><br />The presentation is a little different to the ones we've done before. &nbsp;Previously we've gone into how it works and why it's fast. &nbsp;This time I wanted to step back a little from the internals and show how real developers might actually use it. &nbsp;The example is somewhat contrived, but the idea is to give some hints on how to break your problem down into something that will work with a Disruptor at the heart of it.<br /><br />I thought the event went really well. &nbsp;It was a tiny bit <i>completely</i> intimidating, as there were no lightning talks and I was the only attraction. &nbsp;Seeing over a hundred people turn up after work, before beer, to hear you talk is a humbling experience. &nbsp;Fortunately, I think the audience was perfect for the presentation - they had heard of the Disruptor but hadn't seen anything very detailed about it, so my walkthrough of how you might use it seemed to go down well. &nbsp;I certainly got a lot of very sensible questions (which hopefully I've remembered to repeat for the benefit of the recording), and people had some good ideas about how and when to use it.<br /><br />I ran the same presentation to a different audience at QCon London a week later, I'll post a link to that if/when it becomes available.
