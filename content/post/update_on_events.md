Just a quick note to say I was <a href="http://www.star107.co.uk/podcasts/the-app-show/show-13-podcast.mp3">interviewed for another podcast</a>, again to talk about all-female events. &nbsp;It's only a short one and there's probably not much in there that I haven't said before, either on here or in person.<br /><br />From the 21st May, I'm at GOTO, both Copenhagen and Amsterdam. &nbsp;I'll be talking about code &amp; the Disruptor, thank goodness, and will be trying not to rant about the subject of women in technology. &nbsp;If you see me there, come and say hello!<br /><br />On Friday 25th May, after all the GOTO craziness, I'm going to repeat the Disruptor presentation in Rotterdam at <a href="http://010dev.nl/">010DEV</a>, an event rather fantastically called "The Disruptor and the Perfect Programmer", which someone on Twitter correct noted sounds like a fairy tale.<br /><br />After all that, I'm hopefully going to take June off to play Diablo 3 and Prototype 2, and read the next Game of Thrones book. &nbsp;All these joys I have been denying myself to make sure I get everything sorted in time for next week.
