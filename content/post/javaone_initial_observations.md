So I've been at JavaOne for the better part of three days, it's time to record some of my observations so far:<br /><br /><ul><li>The wireless access is rubbish.</li><li>&lt;Gross generalisation&gt; technical people are not natural public speakers. &nbsp;Makes me feel better about the presentations I'm going to be giving (see <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/32877942/">A Beginner's Guide to Hardcore Concurrency</a>).</li><li>The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting. &nbsp;I've had a really excellent time, I've met: people from other Java User Groups; the <a href="http://jduchess.org/">Duchess</a> girls; other Duke Award winners; the <a href="http://www.azulsystems.com/">Azul</a> guys; guys (well, girls) from O'Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.</li><li>Everyone thinks that Large is an acceptable default t-shirt size (it's not). &nbsp;Vendors - if you're really serious about appealing to The Other Gender you need to stock XS, if not actual skinny tees.</li><li>If you're running a conference, you should probably have your projection screens <i>above</i> the height of the audience members' heads</li><li>People at JavaOne are dead friendly. &nbsp;I've ended up in a lot of conversations just by virtue of standing alone for longer than 30 seconds. &nbsp;It is noticeably easier to talk to people here than at the conferences I've been attending in London. &nbsp;Not sure if that's a location thing or a domain thing.</li><li>Socialising in London is <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/09/what-my-hangovers-can-teach-you-about.html">great practice</a> for this sort of event. &nbsp;I am capable of taking advantage of free drink and still maintaining a conversation and staying upright in 6 inch heels.</li><li>I miss American breakfasts. &nbsp;I've been gorging myself on pancakes, biscuits and gravy, and eggs benedict. &nbsp;I'll be calling my personal trainer as soon as I return.</li><li>Haven't seen anything to contradict my view that San Francisco is not the Brit's typical view of California - the weather is rubbish. &nbsp;London has been hotter and sunnier this week.</li><li>Sharing an apartment with your CTO is not as weird as you might think. &nbsp;Especially if you relegate him to the closet (no, that's not a euphemism).</li><li>It's difficult to remember to Tweet or blog when you're totally engrossed in conversations with people.</li></ul><div>Here's a photo of me representing <a href="http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/">LMAX</a> as I pick up the <a href="http://java.com/en/dukeschoice/index.jsp">Duke Award</a> we won for the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/">Disruptor</a>:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z4fj8X89gh8/TouHpDgIy4I/AAAAAAAAIKs/v_3k_WC8rCU/s1600/duke.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="313" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z4fj8X89gh8/TouHpDgIy4I/AAAAAAAAIKs/v_3k_WC8rCU/s320/duke.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;(Thanks to <a href="http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/">Martijn</a> for taking the photo).</div><div><br /></div><div>I was grabbed for an interview which should be available (un-edited - erk!) on&nbsp;<a href="http://java.net/">java.net</a>&nbsp;at some point, I'll post it when it's available (if it's not rubbish).</div>
