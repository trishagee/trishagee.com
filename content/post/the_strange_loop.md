Last week (was it only last week?) I was at <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a>, presenting a <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/strangeloop-disruptor-workshop-materials.html">workshop on the Disruptor</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jt5DFeC5wNo/UGee7BSeo3I/AAAAAAAALJY/le-weiSydUs/s1600/hotel.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jt5DFeC5wNo/UGee7BSeo3I/AAAAAAAALJY/le-weiSydUs/s320/hotel.png" width="320" /></a></div>I didn't really have any expectations from the conference, I've never been before and, if I'm honest, hadn't heard of it before. &nbsp;So everything was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />It's a very geeky conference. &nbsp;I mean that as a compliment, of course. &nbsp;Lots of very smart people talking about stuff that's waaaay more advanced than you frequently get in the conferences employers would be happy to pay for. &nbsp;The themes I mostly saw were functional programming and the (insert horribly abused term) Big Data space.<br /><br />So nothing about Spring and Hibernate or any of their ilk, of course. &nbsp;Almost nothing about Java actually, as if a language that is actually used by millions of developers is somehow too&nbsp;pass√©. &nbsp;But this was extremely liberating - if there's nothing that's going to be applicable to my day job, I can go and see talks on things I'm actually interested in. &nbsp;That's not to say the day job is not interesting, of course, but removing the constraint meant the only criteria for selecting talks was "Will I learn something I didn't know before?".<br /><br />My favourite talk was Jeff Hawkins' keynote, <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/computing-like-the-brain">Computing Like the Brain</a>. &nbsp;It was as if he was trying to download several decades of research on neuroscience into our brains in less than 30 minutes. &nbsp;It was incredible! &nbsp;Fascinating, and the stuff of science fiction.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QaupZv7WIN0/UGeh0uLL_qI/AAAAAAAALJw/4GKastaWFvM/s1600/foyer.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QaupZv7WIN0/UGeh0uLL_qI/AAAAAAAALJw/4GKastaWFvM/s320/foyer.png" width="320" /></a></div>The quality of speakers was really good, big names that many would recognise, all talking about their passions. &nbsp;And it was another friendly conference, where lots of people appeared to be there on their own, and were happy to get chatting to randoms like me.<br /><br />There were a <i>lot</i> of people too. &nbsp;I had expected it to be quite a small, intimate conference. &nbsp;But while it's not JavaOne, there were a lot more people than I expected.<br /><br />I've never been to St Louis before either. &nbsp;However, since I voluntarily spent all my time between the hotel and the venue, I think I can safely say I still haven't really been there. &nbsp;But <a href="http://peabodyoperahouse.com/">the venue</a> and <a href="http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/stlus-st-louis-union-station-marriott/">the hotel</a> were really beautiful places, as well as being dead conveniently placed.<br /><br />So I enjoyed Strange Loop. &nbsp;It was a little strange, and I was out of my comfort zone, but I had an interesting time and met yet more great people. &nbsp;I'd love to go again next year, if I get the chance (hint hint).
