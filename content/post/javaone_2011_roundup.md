Having been back in London for a few days I've had some time to digest the madness that was last week.<br /><br />My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. &nbsp;Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I'm just not jaded yet. &nbsp;But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/10/java-one-initial-observations.html">last post</a>):<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RlwrbbMeTWI/TpWq7Aw_7OI/AAAAAAAAIQ0/UiDjINFvXjo/s1600/bruno.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="219" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RlwrbbMeTWI/TpWq7Aw_7OI/AAAAAAAAIQ0/UiDjINFvXjo/s320/bruno.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><ul><li>First and foremost, the people. &nbsp;I don't remember meeting a single grumpy person. Everyone I spoke to was there to get the most out of the experience, regardless of how many times they'd been previously. &nbsp;In my experience, techies are not conditioned to be socially comfortable, yet&nbsp;introductions were made and&nbsp;the conversations flowed easily.</li><li>Of course it wasn't just the attendees who were friendly, the staff and organisers were approachable and helpful, and it was nice to have people hanging around to direct you.</li><li>One of the (few) advantages of having the event over multiple hotels was the outdoor space between them. &nbsp;It's unfortunate that it rained, &nbsp;but I really liked being able to hang around outside. &nbsp;I especially liked that they had provided power points for your laptop, so you didn't have to be cooped up indoors to update your blog. &nbsp;I also thought that having to walk between the venues was good exercise, given I didn't make it to the gym last week. However I can see why people want to move the event back to one central location.</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UOsWpFnYjSw/TpWrGSgqheI/AAAAAAAAIQ8/Hx8nyX5S3uA/s1600/martijn.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UOsWpFnYjSw/TpWrGSgqheI/AAAAAAAAIQ8/Hx8nyX5S3uA/s200/martijn.jpg" width="177" /></a></div><ul><li>I personally found the sessions less useful than the networking. &nbsp;I mostly attended the high-performance / concurrency sessions, but I probably should have been to ones about things I <i>didn't</i> know (e.g. other JVM languages). &nbsp;My favourite session was <a href="http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/">Martijn's</a> Diabolical Developer session, but then I'm a fan of stand-up comedy. &nbsp;</li><li>Another favourite was the <a href="http://javaposse.com/">Java Posse</a>&nbsp;live podcast. &nbsp;I'm ashamed to admit that I've never listened to one before (my excuse: I don't listen to podcasts at all because I don't have a long commute to work, which would be the ideal time). &nbsp;I thought it was great how everyone felt like a part of the Java Posse and not a passive audience.</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8az7qiRldX8/TpWro5J2Z2I/AAAAAAAAIRM/fCD-liE8g9o/s1600/javaposse.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8az7qiRldX8/TpWro5J2Z2I/AAAAAAAAIRM/fCD-liE8g9o/s320/javaposse.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><ul><li>I really felt that Oracle was trying its best to invoke the spirit of community. &nbsp;Maybe that's because when I wasn't in sessions or having random conversations, I was in Java User Group or <a href="http://jcp.org/en/home/index">Java Community Process</a> events. &nbsp;It seems pretty clear to me that the inclusion of <a href="http://soujava.org.br/">SouJava</a> and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/">London Java Community</a> in the JCP EC has shaken things up a bit. &nbsp;But then, I would say that - I'm biased. &nbsp;But the vibe I was getting across the whole conference was that having the community involved in this key decision-making organisation is a step forward. &nbsp;I would even go so far as to claim that it inspired a number of other players to seriously consider getting on board rather than complaining from the sidelines.</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vuIJB2I4Elo/TpWrcuMqwoI/AAAAAAAAIRE/M8Y6MkPZW6E/s1600/jduchess.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="145" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vuIJB2I4Elo/TpWrcuMqwoI/AAAAAAAAIRE/M8Y6MkPZW6E/s320/jduchess.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><ul><li>On a related note, I really enjoyed the final <a href="http://www.oracle.com/ocom/groups/systemobject/@mktg_admin/documents/webcontent/videoplayer-ocom.html?bctid=1176404830001&amp;playerID=single-social&amp;size=events">keynote on community</a>. To me, that was an indication that Oracle takes our participation very seriously. &nbsp;I liked that it was split into a lot of different interviews and panels, all quite short, which showcased the variety of the Java platform community. &nbsp;I came out of that feeling pretty warm and fluffy about the future of our technology, and proud to be an active part of it.</li></ul><div>Stuff I was not so bothered about:</div><div><ul><li>Vendor keynotes. &nbsp;Pretty dull to be honest. &nbsp;I understand why they had them but after the first one I didn't turn up to any more.</li><li>The other bad points I already mentioned in the last post.</li></ul><div>Personal highlights:</div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aovhDAhVoKI/TpWryE1AKMI/AAAAAAAAIRU/vnwMqPGquSQ/s1600/intro-to-disruptor.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="154" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aovhDAhVoKI/TpWryE1AKMI/AAAAAAAAIRU/vnwMqPGquSQ/s200/intro-to-disruptor.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><div><ul><li>Picking up the Duke's Choice Award (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/ocom/groups/public/@ocom/documents/digitalasset/512339.jpg">video</a>&nbsp;- note: only seems to work in Firefox for me) for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/">the Disruptor</a>. Yeah yeah, I'll shut up about it at some point, let me have my moment of glory.</li><li>Co-presenting a session on the Disruptor with <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/">Martin</a>. &nbsp;He invited me to stand up with him when we realised I could go to the event, and I was terrified of the thought. &nbsp;So I did it.</li><li>Meeting and being interviewed by the <a href="http://jduchess.org/">JDuchess</a> ladies. &nbsp;The video doesn't seem to be available, so maybe I was rubbish, but it was a cool thing for me all the same.</li><li>Talking about the Disruptor for the <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/javaspotlight/entry/java_spotlight_episode_51_live">Java Spotlight Podcast</a>&nbsp;and the Oracle news guys (again, I can't find the content for this yet).</li></ul></div><div>I had a really brilliant time, and would love to repeat the experience again as soon as possible!</div>
