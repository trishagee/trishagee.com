...there are a number of points in <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/paul-oldfield-interview">this interview</a> with Paul Oldfield which are interesting to consider when thinking about "doing Agile right".&nbsp; It seems to be compatible with my "people over process" view - I'm not stating that having good people negates the need for any form of process or discipline, I have seen that this is simply not the case.&nbsp; I do however think that agile techniques in particular rely heavily upon the "right" people / team, for some nebulous definition of&nbsp; "right".
