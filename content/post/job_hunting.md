I've learnt a lot professionally and personally during my time here in New York, but the time has come to go back "home".<br/><br/>I'll be relocating to London in September.  I guess it won't hurt to mention on here that I'll be looking for an exciting new job when I get back there.  Check out my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/trishagee">LinkedIn profile</a> if you are in the market for a Java tech team lead.
