I've produced a very cut down version of the presentation I've been giving at a lot of conferences, giving a high level overview to the <a href="http://lmax-exchange.github.com/disruptor/">Disruptor</a>. &nbsp;This serves as a quick intro to the concepts behind it.<br /><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="356" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/14664796" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" width="427"> </iframe> <br /><div style="align: center; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/introduction-to-the-disruptor" target="_blank" title="Introduction to the Disruptor">Introduction to the Disruptor</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee" target="_blank">Trisha Gee</a></strong> </div><br />My slides are usually pretty useless without me (or someone else) talking over them, so for more context don't forget there's always my original blog posts (the <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-whats-so-special.html">Magic Ring Buffer</a>, <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-how-do-i-read-from.html">Reading from it</a>, <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-writing-to-ring.html">Writing to it</a>, <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-wiring-up.html">Wiring it up</a>), which are now pretty dated, and the <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/java-magazine-intro-to-disruptor-part.html">Java Magazine</a> article I wrote at the start of the year.
