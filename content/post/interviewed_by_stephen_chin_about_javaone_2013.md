Yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/steveonjava">Stephen Chin</a>, one of Oracle's Java Evangelists and the JavaOne content chair, interviewed me via a live stream about <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne</a>, the <a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/58136652766/the-mongodb-java-driver-3-0">new MongoDB Java driver</a>, and my plans to Change The World.<br /><br />It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop. &nbsp;There's a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it's not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I'd like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MdOHjGtITjo?list=PLX8CzqL3ArzXMvt5y8VHXKmr8gDC-xOH_" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
