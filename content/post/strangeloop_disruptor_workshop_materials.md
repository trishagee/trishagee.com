On Sunday I gave my very first workshop on the Disruptor. &nbsp;The aim was to give people some hands-on coding experience using the syntax. &nbsp;Because time was limited (you can't get people to build an entire application architecture in 2.5 hours) the example is somewhat contrived, and needs a big leap to make it into a proper application context. &nbsp;But the workshop should:<br /><ol><li>Give an overview of the Disruptor</li><li>Show how to create a simple one producer, one consumer example.</li><li>Show how to wire up a parallel event handler</li><li>Show how to how (and why) to create a diamond dependency graph.</li><li>Extrapolate beyond these very simple examples to something closer to a real world architecture.</li></ol><div>Requirements are:</div><div><ol><li>Basic Java skills</li><li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java 7 update 7</a></li><li>(Optionally) <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a>.</li></ol><div>The slides (not all that useful, I'll grant you, without me talking) are available, and you can <a href="http://db.tt/9AjcSh1m">download the code</a>.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>If you want to work through the examples yourself, start with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">com.mechanitis.towerdefense.TowerDefence</span>. &nbsp;The starting point code for the workshop is in package&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">com.mechanitis.towerdefense</span>. &nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">com.mechanitis.towerdefense1</span> shows a solution to exercise one,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">com.mechanitis.towerdefense2</span> to exercise 2 and so forth. &nbsp;The final package,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">com.mechanitis.towerdefense4</span>, has some different towers you can play with to see the effects. &nbsp;They don't really show anything special about the Disruptor, but they were fun to write and are interesting to play with.</div><br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><iframe frameborder="0" height="400" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/14458348?hostedIn=slideshare&amp;page=upload" width="476"></iframe></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
