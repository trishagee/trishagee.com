And now, a post for my long-neglected, less technical readers.<br /><br />I took a week off in July to try and avoid that Oh My God I Missed Summer Again feeling.  Granted, it's easy to get that in the UK even if you're not stuck in an office the entire time.<br /><br />Really this is just an excuse to post some photos on the blog.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mOMqqFVCFi8/TkY2yVOPIiI/AAAAAAAAIJs/5vZHMmyqubk/s1600/Embankment.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="268" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mOMqqFVCFi8/TkY2yVOPIiI/AAAAAAAAIJs/5vZHMmyqubk/s400/Embankment.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><b>Monday</b><br />Hopped on the bike and explored from Kensington to Westminster.<br /><br />Felt distinctly smug when I grabbed my lunch from Victoria amongst all the less fortunate people who had to go back to their offices.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WxvvRy0iE9w/TkY3P8gtp_I/AAAAAAAAIJw/qXE_1DbSUV4/s1600/Gull.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WxvvRy0iE9w/TkY3P8gtp_I/AAAAAAAAIJw/qXE_1DbSUV4/s400/Gull.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><b>Tuesday</b><br />Decided to dose up on Culture, and went to the <a href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/">National Gallery</a>. &nbsp;Last time I was there I was eight years old, and I distinctly remember admiring the frames more than the art.<br /><br />The rather&nbsp;marvellous&nbsp;<a href="http://www.artfinder.com/">Artfinder</a> makes up for the fact that you can't take photos inside the gallery - I can share most of the <a href="http://www.artfinder.com/user/4229/collection/tuesday/public/">pieces that struck me</a> when I was there.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-THH2_9dBQL8/TkY6P5ka5zI/AAAAAAAAIJ0/IHCur57_naA/s1600/Secret.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-THH2_9dBQL8/TkY6P5ka5zI/AAAAAAAAIJ0/IHCur57_naA/s400/Secret.jpg" width="267" /></a></div><b>Wednesday</b><br />Finally got around to embarking on one of the walks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-London-Exploring-Original-Unusual/dp/1566566363?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">Secret London</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=1566566363" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;" width="1" />. &nbsp;I chose to do the City, from St Paul's, covering Bank, Monument and Liverpool St.<br /><br />It was&nbsp;fascinating. I've worked in a lot of places round there, socialise there regularly, and have explored a number of the nooks and crannies. &nbsp;But I was astounded at how many places I had never seen, alleys I had no idea existed, and gardens hidden away between modern office blocks.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WyWhmBr0Ay8/TkY7VjTQQRI/AAAAAAAAIJ4/5TJmXfQ_644/s1600/LondonBridge.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WyWhmBr0Ay8/TkY7VjTQQRI/AAAAAAAAIJ4/5TJmXfQ_644/s400/LondonBridge.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><b>Thursday</b><br />My parents dropped by and I racked my brain for a different way to explore this massive, old city. &nbsp;And it came to me: using the artery of the city - the river. &nbsp;So we took a boat to Greenwich.<br /><br />Where they were <a href="http://www.wharf.co.uk/2011/07/batman-filming-in-greenwich.html">filming Batman</a>.<br /><br />And I didn't know until after we'd left.<br /><br />Gutted.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WTSxxolJIlg/TkY7vahoneI/AAAAAAAAIJ8/VIteMVNt6Uo/s1600/Sky.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WTSxxolJIlg/TkY7vahoneI/AAAAAAAAIJ8/VIteMVNt6Uo/s400/Sky.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><b>Friday</b><br />The sun finally makes an appearance. I was going to write a blog post, but I refuse to be indoors on a sunny day if I can get outside for some Vitamin D production (and I hadn't bought my <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air">new shiny</a> then).<br /><br />Sat in the park, sunbathed. <br /><br />Brilliant day.<br /><br />Brilliant week.<br /><br /><br />
