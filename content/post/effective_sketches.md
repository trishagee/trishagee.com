On Thursday I was at <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/09/02/effective_sketches_at_skills_matter.html">Simon Brown's Effective Sketches</a> session at <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skillsmatter</a>. &nbsp;Just because my pictures are pretty awesome doesn't mean there's no opportunity for continuous learning.<br /><br />The points Simon made in the session really made sense to me, and I wish I could have had something like that as a primer when they taught us UML at university. &nbsp;Without the context of what the diagrams were supposed to mean, to convey, all the boxes and lines made no sense to me back then. &nbsp;I'm still not a fan of large chunks of UML because I think the convention sometimes gets in the way of real meaning.<br /><br />My take-away points were:<br /><ul><li>Don't try and squidge everything onto a single diagram. &nbsp;The reason lots of different flavours of architecture diagrams exist (e.g. <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/pages/book/logical-view.html">logical view</a>, <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/pages/book/infrastructure-view.html">infrastructure view</a>, etc) is because you have different audiences for each of the diagrams and different things that are important when you're looking at it from one particular angle.</li><li>One diagram you particularly need, especially if you are producing a stack of documentation for a system (e.g. you're a consultant presenting findings to the client) is a really <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/pages/book/context-view.html">succinct, summary view</a> of what the system is actually trying to achieve.</li><li>If you're not going to use UML, you should at least agree on consistency and some conventions - for example, does the direction of an arrow represent data flow or dependency?</li><li>UML tools make it easier to represent different views of a data model and retain consistency. &nbsp;One diagram is less likely to contradict a different view if your sketching tool points this mistake out to you.</li><li>Yes, your code should be self-documenting. &nbsp;But you can't give the code to your business customers or expect your hardware guys to figure out your requirements from it. &nbsp;To pass knowledge around the business it's more efficient to have diagrams representing the shared understanding of the domain.</li><li>Architecture diagrams should show the intent and the vision of the system.</li></ul><div>I also used my laptop to take notes for the first time. &nbsp;In the past I've preferred not to use a laptop, because a) I like pencil and paper and it allows me to <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/phq_PRPQOYxViiz4Il6ONDDlgmlkuyHYOu3BaLXdFVg?feat=directlink">doodle</a> and b) the temptation to read my e-mail or check facebook is not something I want to succumb to. &nbsp;But <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/08/27/using_evernote_for_training_courses.html">using Evernote</a> really worked for me, I could annotate the slides with my notes, and it made converting my notes into this post a lot easier.</div><div><br /></div><div>PS it has not escaped me that this is one post without a diagram. &nbsp;The irony is not lost on me.</div>
