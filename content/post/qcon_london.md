Last week saw the first <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/conference/">QCon London</a> conference, an event "designed with the technical depth and enterprise focus of interest to technical team leads, architects, and project managers".<br/><br/>The conference consisted of two days of tutorials followed by three days of talks covering technologies, vendor products, and processes.  In addition there were numerous "networking" opportunities with plenty of break times to both absorb information and meet other people, plus evening events.<br/><br/>The conference was both comprehensive and absorbing, and I'm hoping to take the next few days to filter through the notes I have taken and present a more succinct version here.  Whether it will be of use to anyone other than myself remains to be seen...
