The <a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/59769560940/the-mongodb-java-driver-3-0-whats-changing">second in my short series of blogs</a> about the new Java driver is now available for your perusal. &nbsp;In it, there's some guidance on how to get started using the new driver, whether you want to use the new (unfinished) API, the existing "classic" API, or a blend of both.<br /><br />The post also shows that <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a> is prettier than <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>. &nbsp;Sorry Maven.<br /><br />If you are going to play with the new driver, please read all the caveats carefully. &nbsp;I know it looks a bit like the warnings on your prescription medicine, but it serves the same purpose. &nbsp;Short version: the driver is not finished yet, and should not be used in production.<br /><br />We really want to hear your experiences with the driver - it is an open source project and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> is very much driven by the community, we want to hear from you. &nbsp;But only if you say nice things. &nbsp;No, seriously, please tell us if you have problems, if functionality is missing, if your tests fail if you start to use it, etc etc etc.<br /><br />Go play.
