I like QCon London, I really do. &nbsp;Not only is it on home turf, but, <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/qcon-london-2012.html">as I've said before</a>, it doesn't just focus on technology, or a set of technologies.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t0Q7ewOcjVk/UTfM32qZNcI/AAAAAAAALZ4/Hg0KDsMxPqA/s1600/2013-03-05+16.35.12.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t0Q7ewOcjVk/UTfM32qZNcI/AAAAAAAALZ4/Hg0KDsMxPqA/s640/2013-03-05+16.35.12.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />Full disclosure: I've been involved in planning QCon this year. &nbsp;So this time I know all the thinking, hard work, planning and last-minute changes that go into a conference like this. &nbsp;And it's a joy to be able to sit in the audience and see the conference that you've helped build.<br /><br />There are things I took out of today that I want to get down on "paper" now, because I think the next few days will have different themes.<br /><br /><b>Let's Not Forget About Computer Science</b><br />I'm so pleased to see this in a conference! &nbsp;After documenting and talking about the <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/disruptor">Disruptor</a> so much last year, I felt it was important for us to go back to our roots a bit, and have some <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/">Mechanical Sympathy</a>. &nbsp;Some of the sessions today brought us back to the school room and had us thinking about the tools we're using.<br /><br />In my new role I'm doing something I've never had to do before, and that's writing a library that will be used by other developers. &nbsp;<a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/speaker/Barbara+Liskov">Barbara Liskov's</a> keynote had me thinking hard about "readability over writability" and "design for the case that is used most often". &nbsp;I also came out slightly depressed that some things hadn't changed in 40 years. &nbsp;<a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/">Martin Thompson's</a> talk made me wish I had written my driver performance tests up front, and poked me to continue thinking about our users' performance needs. &nbsp;I'd like to say <a href="http://damian.conway.org/About_us/Bio_formal.html">Damian Conway's</a> keynote made me want to code in Latin, but in fact it motivated me to get back to learning Spanish. &nbsp;But it also (unintentionally) backed up a point I've heard before, which is that programming is at least twice as hard to learn if you don't speak English. &nbsp;Probably worse if you don't speak a European language.<br /><br />Overall, the message I took from the combination of these sessions is that it's almost more important than ever to get back to basics. &nbsp;Stop obsessing about frameworks and tools and different flavoured JVM languages. &nbsp;Start remembering all these things are tools, that they run on machines that work with ones and zeros. &nbsp;Whatever abstractions we're using, we will write better, cleaner, more performant, fit-for-purpose code if we understand our tools, and their strengths and weaknesses. &nbsp;One of these tools is even our own brain - understand how it shapes the information and presents us with solutions.<br /><br /><b>Art Is Awesome (and Useful)</b><br />I went a bit off topic to go to two sessions on visual information. &nbsp;My excuse is that this blog needs more pictures, and I want more visual ways of representing what's going on with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>/the driver.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aG1cjS5pg1A/UTfWgtAGD3I/AAAAAAAALaI/SFUo828A-DU/s1600/Notes+5+(page+1).png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="331" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aG1cjS5pg1A/UTfWgtAGD3I/AAAAAAAALaI/SFUo828A-DU/s400/Notes+5+(page+1).png" width="400" /></a></div><a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/speaker/Heather+Willems">Heather Willem's</a> session encouraged us to doodle throughout. &nbsp;In fact, forced us to. &nbsp;Right up front she adresses the fact that doodling is seen as a lack of attention, as a waste of time. &nbsp;And I realised, sitting there in the audience with my iPad and stylus, that I did feel guilty drawing away while someone talked at me. &nbsp;But it was a brilliant exercise in unblocking some of those creative juices, and letting us see the power in visual information. &nbsp;Perfect is not important, pictures are powerful.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLTnBK3ghYc/UTfKjTqIYSI/AAAAAAAALZo/uHIDDa-gxn4/s1600/Notes+5+(page+2).png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="330" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLTnBK3ghYc/UTfKjTqIYSI/AAAAAAAALZo/uHIDDa-gxn4/s400/Notes+5+(page+2).png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Fernando Orellana is an artist fascinated by building machines to create art. &nbsp;It was awesome to see an artist who also builds robots and codes stuff to do what he wants. &nbsp;He said "code is like paint, I use it to create". &nbsp;See? I <i>knew</i> coding was a creative activity. &nbsp;He's done some stuff that I probably would have been tempted to say "is that art?", like aiming to create <a href="http://fernandoorellana.com/projects/extruder/">40 000 play doh cars</a>. &nbsp;Or making creepy rodents that live in "dumb little&nbsp;suburban&nbsp;homes" out of singing hamster toys. &nbsp;<a href="http://fernandoorellana.com/">Go to his website</a> and watch the videos, nothing else can describe it. &nbsp;I was blown away, it was inspiring. &nbsp;And useful too for sparking creativity in all of us.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iZxEdZOP1k4/UTfKqXejghI/AAAAAAAALZw/epR56z099yQ/s1600/Notes+5+(page+14).png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="331" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iZxEdZOP1k4/UTfKqXejghI/AAAAAAAALZw/epR56z099yQ/s400/Notes+5+(page+14).png" width="400" /></a></div><br />Here's my "subconscious&nbsp;drawing" from the start of the session. &nbsp;We need more child-like art in our lives.<br /><br />These two sessions really rekindled my desire to do arty, drawing-y creative stuff. &nbsp;And helped me see how fear blocks many of us from using this medium.<br /><br /><b>And...</b><br />Sitting in the audience as an attendee, different things jump out at you. &nbsp;I was shocked, as someone who's been involved in suggesting and selecting speakers, at how few women there were again on this first day. &nbsp;My thought was, how could this happen with me on the committee?? &nbsp;So I have more sympathy for conference organisers than I did, when facing this tough problem, but more conviction than ever that we need to do something different to showcase different types of role models.<br /><br />On the other hand, it might be my imagination or wishful thinking, but the overall diversity of the attendees seemed much greater than recent years, which is a Good Thing.<br /><br />I'm sorry for bringing up this subject again, but you might consider it blind of me not to notice something in a conference I've actually worked on.<br /><br /><b>But overall</b><br />I've been really impressed with the first day of the conference. &nbsp;Not only was it, of course, a great opportunity to meet new people, catch up with old friends, and generally network, the sessions that I went to were excellent, and have me excited to be working in this industry, at this time. &nbsp;And to be in a position to hear about it all. &nbsp;And maybe, just maybe, contribute something of my own.
