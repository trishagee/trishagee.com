the JUG Leaders and <a href="http://jduchess.org/">Duchess</a> folk; the JCP EC committee members; and loads of people who live and work in the area who I wouldn't normally get a chance to speak to in person.<br /><br />This year I'm here with several other&nbsp;<a href="http://www.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/">London Java Community</a>&nbsp;people, and it's great to be a member of the Alumni, to have the privilege of showing other guys around and introducing people to each other. &nbsp;It's nice to run into people I met here for the first time last year, some of whom I've had a chance to see at other events this year.<br /><br />Today, Sunday, is an interesting day. &nbsp;The focus is on community, so I get to hear what other JUGs are doing, some of their pain points, and learn some of the things they're doing that maybe we should think about. <br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lm0BeJifdNs/UGnYYDgNbVI/AAAAAAAALKI/rWANg1dfTks/s1600/DSC_0279.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lm0BeJifdNs/UGnYYDgNbVI/AAAAAAAALKI/rWANg1dfTks/s320/DSC_0279.JPG" width="320" /></a>The day started well, with Jim and Richard de-mystifying the business and technology&nbsp;terminology&nbsp;we're bound to come across at this conference. &nbsp;8:15am is a really harsh time to have to do your first presentation, but it had a good turnout and was a great way to kick off the conference.<br /><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span><span style="text-align: center;">I followed this with a talk about why you would open source&nbsp;your secrets, a short presentation detailing the benefits to your business of opening up parts of your codebase. &nbsp;It went better than expected, given my voice has all but disappeared due to a stupid cold and plane travel and jet lag (and noisy bars). &nbsp;I had contingency plans on how to present via typing or drawing on my iPad, but in the end I managed even despite the microphone not being turned on. &nbsp;Doh.</span><br /><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y3i2xpoKxdM/UGnapgQNiiI/AAAAAAAALKQ/SRkBw51f9Kk/s1600/DSC_0289.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="267" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y3i2xpoKxdM/UGnapgQNiiI/AAAAAAAALKQ/SRkBw51f9Kk/s400/DSC_0289.JPG" width="400" /></a><br />There were a series of presentations on how to make your JUG successful and how to run Adopt a JSR/OpenJDK programmes in your user group, before <a href="https://twitter.com/kittylyst">Ben</a> and I had to dash off to the public EC meeting. &nbsp;This was not as well-attended as last year, but it meant that I had a chance to talk to all the EC members, and to drink more free champagne than one really ought to in the afternoon.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j-qDgQoK7EQ/UGncAE5vqYI/AAAAAAAALKY/F6R2jOURWjc/s1600/DSC_0291.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j-qDgQoK7EQ/UGncAE5vqYI/AAAAAAAALKY/F6R2jOURWjc/s320/DSC_0291.JPG" width="214" /></a></div>Next on the packed schedule was a trip to yet another location (seriously, that's 4 different locations just on Sunday) for the keynotes. &nbsp;Note: next time I say "it's not far, let's walk" in San Francisco, hit me with sticks. &nbsp;That's the second time in as many days I've been hit with a vertical distance that was further than the horizontal. &nbsp;At least this time I wasn't wheeling my luggage up the hill like I was on Friday.<br /><br />The keynotes were definitely better than last year. &nbsp;I really enjoyed how the technical keynote put the shiny new stuff into an everyday context - seeing JavaFX running on all the platforms, including embedded, and seeing lambdas used in anger, was really engaging. &nbsp;In my mind, it's much more likely to get "real" developers using these things. &nbsp;I particularly enjoyed the interplay between Mark Reinhold and Brian Goetz, it's great to see people like that so passionate about what they're doing, it really humanizes them and their projects.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ODxw1aQyY-E/UGnlEk2QI4I/AAAAAAAALK8/DLZYaOE33kI/s1600/DSC_0311.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ODxw1aQyY-E/UGnlEk2QI4I/AAAAAAAALK8/DLZYaOE33kI/s320/DSC_0311.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>The last trip of the day was back down the hill to one of the many parties scheduled this week. &nbsp;Of course, it's not in every party that you get given an award, so this was particularly sweet - the London Java Community has been honoured with a <a href="http://www.java.net/dukeschoice">Duke's Choice Award</a>. &nbsp;This is the first year a community has won a "Dukey", and it's amazing to be part of a group of people who are actively contributing to the language I work with daily, and to be recognised for this. &nbsp;So yes, I was on stage getting an award again. &nbsp;It's addictive.<br /><br />So, a really great kick off to this year's JavaOne, and I'm back at the apartment well before my coach (well, <a href="http://uber.com/invite/w2rk7">Uber</a>) turns into a pumpkin and resting my voice in time for my Disruptor presentation tomorrow.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
