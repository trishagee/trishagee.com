I feel slightly like a traitor to my own blog, as I've written a blog post for Somewhere Else. &nbsp;I've written about the <a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/58136652766/the-mongodb-java-driver-3-0">design goals for the 3.0 MongoDB Java Driver</a> in the official MongoDB blog (seems sensible, right?). &nbsp;I'm not sure how I feel about cross-posting the entire contents, so I'm just linking you to them instead.<br /><br />Anyone who's been to my Backwards Compatibility presentation this year might notice something familiar about the content. &nbsp;The talk covers the design goals of the new driver, and this blog post will let you read them in your own time rather than having me fire them at you at 100mph.
