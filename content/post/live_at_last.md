We went live with &quot;real&quot; customers this week just gone. &nbsp;It's the culmination of nearly two years work for me personally, and three years for our company.<br/><br/><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs991.snc4/76493_450908175811_545840811_6068221_1642738_n.jpg"/><br/><br/>It's really nice to be live at last, and to have our name out there.  It might (in fact, should) change the focus of our work.  Without paying customers it's much more difficult to prioritise work based on what they might need or want.<br/><br/>Exciting times for LMAX!
