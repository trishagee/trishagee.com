<div class="p1">So, FOSDEM.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I've heard great things about this conference, so I was pretty exited to go</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PmLM8wpvxns/UvaWZpqWFeI/AAAAAAAAMxI/dqKWFf_PH4M/s1600/JavaDevRoom.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto;

Interestingly, I felt like an impostor at FOSDEM - not because I'm a woman (there were quite a few techy women around at FOSDEM, more than I expected) but because I'm not an open source person.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I mean, I am, technically - <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> and the Java driver are both open source, and I have real live code on github.&nbsp; But I didn't get there via the open source community, I was hired to do a specific job that happens to be open source (for which I am extremely grateful).&nbsp; So although I knew the MongoDB folks I was there with and a lot of people who were running or speaking in the Java room, I didn't feel really at home in this conference.&nbsp; I think I feel more comfortable with the ones aimed at enterprise Java developers (by which I mean Java people who work producing software for companies) because this is more similar to my background - I understand the attendees and I think I know what they want.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">It's also possible since I've been to a lot more of the enterprise-aimed conferences that I used to feel just as awkward there, and I've become much more comfortable now I've been to many.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Which leads me to another observation: when I first went to JavaOne, in 2011, I felt extremely conspicuous as a woman.&nbsp; I mean, I didn't do much to help, my skirts and shorts are occasionally… not really enterprise-developer-length.&nbsp; But I felt like everyone noticed me and I felt the pressure to assert early on in every new conversation that I was, in fact, a developer and not a booth babe or a recruiter.&nbsp; But these days, I feel much more comfortable.&nbsp; And do you know what's really helped with that?&nbsp; Being a speaker; having my face on the website.&nbsp; I don't have to prove I'm a developer, I was asked to speak at that conference - if the conference organisers think I belong there, then I belong there.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">So… what.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Well, we can do things to combat this I-don't-belong-here feeling -&nbsp;I'm pretty sure we've all been there, regardless of gender, race, background etc. &nbsp;To be honest, us geeks probably feel this more than most humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Conferences and user groups and meet ups and so forth can all make life a little easier for those feeling this.&nbsp; At the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/">London Java Community</a>, for example, we started having greeters at the door for our social events, to try and make everyone feel welcomed and to introduce people to each other.&nbsp; I also liked what YOW did - they had a really informal social event at the end of the first day of the conference (with free booze, yay!) which made it relatively easy to mingle with other people.&nbsp; FOSDEM, with its lack of free food and drink gave us less opportunities to mingle with people other than your own friends, although I did like the canteen area for random encounters.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">But it's not just down to organisers of groups or events to solve this problem for us. &nbsp;I've found that if you do feel like you don't belong, there's a way to get over that, and it's not to withdraw.&nbsp; It's to get more involved.&nbsp; Find the groups you feel most comfortable with (for me, it started at the LJC), find the medium that you're most comfortable with (in person meet-ups, e-mail, IRC, Twitter, whatever), and join in.&nbsp; Have conversations.&nbsp; Meet people.&nbsp; Once you start to make friends you start to feel like you belong, and when you start to feel like you belong you can step up and do more.&nbsp; You might even find yourself accidentally propelled into speaking at an international conference, and who knows where you find yourself after that?&nbsp; Although I appreciate that's not for everyone.&nbsp; The point is, find your comfort zone for entry and gradually push yourself more - as you find yourself more accepted and respected, you'll feel less like an outsider. &nbsp;At the very least, you'll have friends to talk to at these sorts of events.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">And don't be put off by a couple of bad experiences - you don't have to go back to that group, those people, that thing, but don't assume that all groups or events are like that. &nbsp;I've been to a number of events, techy or otherwise, that I didn't feel at home with. &nbsp;If, after two tries (in person, I'll give e-mails lists or chat rooms many more chances), I still don't get on with it, I try somewhere else.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><br /><div class="p1">There are still going to be times when you're not in your comfort zone, but this is probably healthy - pushing yourself a little leads to different opportunities.&nbsp; And in my case, it reminded me what it was like to be an outsider, a newbie.&nbsp; And that gives us greater empathy for people in that situation.</div>
