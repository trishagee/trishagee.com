Hmm.  I have been so busy trying to think of "good" things to write here, and not having the time to actually write, that I see it's been 6 months since the last post.<br/><br/>If anyone is still out there though, I need help.  I need a good Certified Scrum Master course in New York or London, preferably in April or May.  Any suggestions?  The one I wanted to go on was vetoed and now I find it's not running in NY again until Autumn.<br/><br/>PS Do you think it would be inappropriate to use the term "Scrum Mistress" on my CV?
