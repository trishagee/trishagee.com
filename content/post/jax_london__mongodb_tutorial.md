In previous years, JAX London would have been an easy, local conference to go to. &nbsp;This time it took me most of Sunday to get there, and not because of the <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/27/its-ok-to-take-the-morning-off-work-if-storm-hits-michael-fish-says-so-4162862/">Super Storm</a>. &nbsp;Still, that gave me the day to finish off the tutorial I was running there on Monday morning. &nbsp;Not that I would be so unprofessional as to leave preparing things until the last minute, oh no....<br /><br />But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java Community. &nbsp;For example, presenting were: <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/andy-piper">Andy Piper</a>; <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/barry-cranford">Barry Cranford</a>; <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/james-gough">Jim Gough</a>; <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/peter-lawrey">Peter Lawrey</a>; <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/sandro-mancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a>;&nbsp;<a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/simon-maple">Simon Maple</a>;&nbsp;<a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/martijn-verburg">Martijn Verburg</a>;&nbsp;<a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/john-oliver">John Oliver</a>: <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/john-stevenson">John Stevenson</a>; <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/richard-warburton">Richard Warburton</a>. The Community Night in particular also drew a lot of LJC members (including some first-timers) to JAX, and it was a really good "networking opportunity" (i.e. chance to have free drinks, catch up with friends and make new ones). &nbsp;I really enjoyed hanging out with everyone at JAX this year, I was tempted to write the names of everyone I spoke to and had fun with because it really made my conference, but I think that would make a very boring blog post. &nbsp;But if I spoke to you at JAX, you made my journey from Spain worthwhile, thank you.<br /><br />As well as the LJC-types, there were some other really big name speakers too, including MongoDB's Chairman <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/dwight-merriman">Dwight Merriman</a>. &nbsp;Highlights for me were:<br /><br /><ul><li>Ken Sipe's <a href="http://www.spockframework.org/">Spock</a> talk. &nbsp;I saw this at GeeCON and that's why <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2013/07/spock-is-awesome-seriously-simplified.html">I started using Spock</a> to test the MongoDB Java driver, but it was great to see it again and pick up some extra tips</li><li>Ted Neward's talk at the community night about being a CTO at a startup. &nbsp;It was really interesting, and nice to see a realistic view of the difficulties of that role. &nbsp;</li><li>James Governor's keynote on how Java got its Mojo back. &nbsp;I like seeing facts and figures to back up a viewpoint, and as you'd expect from the founder of an analyst firm, this talk was full of them.</li></ul><div>As James mentioned during his talk, the audience at JAX was, as in previous years, somewhat passive. &nbsp;I'm not really sure why, as around 50% of the audience came from outside the UK so we can't even blame English reticence. &nbsp;And in a conference full of outspoken LJC-types, it seems an odd thing to have an unresponsive audience. &nbsp;Maybe it's the venue, the main hall in particular seems to lend itself to sitting quietly in the audience and expecting to be entertained.</div><div><br /></div><div>I presented four times at JAX, because, well, on home turf one ends up doing more than one expects.&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>Firstly, a tutorial on the new Java driver for MongoDB (more on this later);&nbsp;</li><li>Secondly, a clinic for novice speakers. &nbsp;This was a lot of fun, and I think it was useful for everyone. &nbsp;I'd love to run this again (I probably will at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ljcopenconference/">LJC Open Conference</a>). &nbsp;The aim is to give new speakers confidence, not focus on details like building a slide deck.</li><li>Thirdly, the third time out for my "Design is a Process, not a Document" presentation. &nbsp;It's a relatively interactive presentation, which I don't think worked so well at JAX, but it's a fun presentation to give.</li><li>Finally, not only did I get roped into being on the panel for "How to start a community" at the community night, I ended up, somehow, moderating it. &nbsp;That was fun, it was the first time I've been a moderator, it's a role I usually avoid as moderators ought to limit the amount of talking they do, which doesn't sound fun to me.</li></ul><div>The tutorial materials are <a href="https://github.com/trishagee/mongodb-java-tutorial">available on GitHub</a>. &nbsp;I haven't provided a lot of guidance on how to get started online, but the exercises are there, and the slides which present the concepts and suggest the order to tackle the tests in. &nbsp;If people use these materials, please feel free to give me feedback on them, but be nice - they were designed for an in-person tutorial, not an online one. &nbsp;But it is a good way to get a feel for the new MongoDB Java API (in its current, unfinished, state).</div></div><div><br /></div><div>So, JAX London - great speakers, and a good conference to meet not only Londoners, but a lot of international people too.</div>
