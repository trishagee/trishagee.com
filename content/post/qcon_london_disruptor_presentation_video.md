The "User's Guide to the Disruptor" presentation I gave at QCon London is now available on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Concurrent-Programming-Using-The-Disruptor#.T8-KKWLH1R4.blogger">InfoQ site</a>. &nbsp;This is the same presentation as the one I gave at <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/new-disruptor-presentation-unveiled-to.html">Skillsmatter in March</a>, but the questions are different. &nbsp;Plus since I'm winging it every time, I probably cover slightly different things or explain some stuff better / worse.
