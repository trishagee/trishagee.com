<div class="p1">I’ve been running into <a href="https://corporate.sky.com/">BSkyB</a> a bunch this week - firstly I was invited to kick off their innovation tech talks series last Monday, then I kept meeting Sky people (that makes it sound like they’re aliens) at <a href="http://qconlondon.com/">QCon</a>.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">It seems Sky is keen to create/foster a culture of innovation, which is an ambitious goal for such a large company.&nbsp; So I was given a very vague brief for Monday’s presentation (“Can you do something Mongo-ish, maybe a bit of performance and concurrency stuff, and talk about overall best practice?”) I gave them an early view of a presentation I’m working on titled something like “Why do we keep reinventing the wheel?” (anyone who saw me at <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/">JFokus</a> might realise that I cunningly swapped out most of the body of the “What do you mean, backwards compatibility?” talk and tried out this topic instead).</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4a4pY12N7xM/Ux2KVRwNLpI/AAAAAAAANRw/gVsUg08fwyU/s1600/TrishaSky.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4a4pY12N7xM/Ux2KVRwNLpI/AAAAAAAANRw/gVsUg08fwyU/s1600/TrishaSky.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: right;">Picture courtesy of&nbsp;<a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/111755189375322301397" target="_blank">+Russell Miles</a>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This was supposed to be a 20 minute intro talk (OK, so I clocked it at 40 minutes in rehearsal) with the rest of the time devoted to questions on any subject I know about, or even anything I have an opinion on.&nbsp; Sounds dangerous, but means I can always move fast on the answers I don’t know in order to cover more ground - cunning, you see?&nbsp; Actually, that sounds like it would be more fun if alcohol were involved.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Anyway.&nbsp; The talk bit of the session took up most of the time, because I had really good questions during the course of the presentation.&nbsp; It’s nice to talk to a much smaller group (there were maybe 30ish people, giving up their free time after work, like an internal user group).&nbsp; But I also had questions on remote working, on creating a culture that’s appealing for developers to come and work in, and on MongoDB.</div><br /><div class="p1">I don’t know how many companies do things like this, or lunchtime brown bags, or something, but I think they’re a great idea.&nbsp; This was a mix of people from different departments, different teams, working on different technologies.&nbsp; It was a good way to get people from across the organisation talking with each other and sharing best practice between teams.&nbsp; Many organisations have people working in their little silo, and we (MongoDB) often find ourselves introducing teams from within the same organisation to each other - there’s no other mechanism for one team to find out about the other.&nbsp; I guess that’s what white-tower architects were supposed to be for - to know what everyone’s up to and make sure people are doing the “right” thing.&nbsp; Given this doesn’t seem to work, what else can we do to share knowledge internally?&nbsp; How else can we get the right people to meet each other?</div>
