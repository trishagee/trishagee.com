I'm finally moving up from working behind the scenes to actually doing a (short) presentation for the LJC. I'm going to be giving a lightning talk on Wednesday at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/17394725/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk event</a>,&nbsp;on&nbsp;the JCP - what it is and what our election to the executive committee means. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/17394725/">Ben and Martin's post</a>&nbsp;gives a little more background on the subject.<br /><br />Another <a href="http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/">LMAX</a> LJC member&nbsp;<a href="http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/">Mike</a> will also be giving a lightning talk, on Project Coin.<br /><br />Now all I have to do is write it...
