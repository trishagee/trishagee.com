If you see anything about <a href="http://www.lmax.com/">LMAX</a> - the Disruptor, Continuous Delivery, or even the selection criteria for hiring developers, you'll see that LMAX is pretty keen on <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a>. &nbsp;However, no-one's documented the Agile process there, as far as I know. &nbsp;Although I personally had it on my todo list, I never had the motivation, the hook to do it. &nbsp;And I realised eventually that's because I'm not sure it's a process that would work very well for another team, in another company, working in another business.<br /><br />The agile process followed at LMAX is one that works for the individuals and the organisation there. &nbsp;And that's because they do one thing very well - they regularly examine the issues faced and adapt the process to try and combat them. &nbsp;It's an agile process that's, well, very agile - it's constantly changing. &nbsp;Documenting it would only represent a single snapshot in time that would be out of date almost as soon as the next retrospective comes along.<br /><br />Any process can inspire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult#Pacific_cults_of_World_War_II">Cargo Cultism</a>, and the last thing I want to do is give people a process to without the tools to know whether it's the right thing for them or not. &nbsp;It's more important to <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/09/what-my-hangovers-can-teach-you-about.html">understand your goals, check progress and improve</a>.<br /><br />I was talking this through with a colleague, Israel, and he rightly pointed out the tool that LMAX can share with everyone else - thinking. &nbsp;Examining the problems, visualising them, and trying out different ways to fix them.<br /><br />So at Devoxx <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraKaos">Israel</a> and I presented a session on "Agile++", using LMAX as a use case of when agile methods work. &nbsp;The session examines four specific issues encountered at LMAX and the steps taken to solve them, and it's available on Parleys. &nbsp;Enjoy.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="395" width="395">  <param name="movie" value="http://www.parleys.com/dist/share/parleysshare.swf"/>  <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/>  <param name="wmode" value="direct"/>  <param name="bgcolor" value="#222222"/>  <param name="flashVars" value="sv=true&amp;pageId=3486"/>  <embed src="http://www.parleys.com/dist/share/parleysshare.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashVars="sv=true&amp;pageId=3486" allowfullscreen="true" bgcolor="#222222" width="395" height="395"/></object></div>
