This <a href="http://www.oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/20120304/?pg=56&amp;pm=1&amp;u1=friend">month's Java Magazine</a>&nbsp;features an article by yours truly, which is yet another intro to the Disruptor. &nbsp;It's basically a summary of the stuff I've written in this blog, updated for version 2.7 - so the names of the classes should be up to date and the responsibilities follow the simplified pattern we use now. &nbsp;If you were looking for an more recent version of my introduction blog posts, this article gives a reasonable overview.<br /><br />This is intended as part one of a series, as it's a basic and high-level view&nbsp;with no code examples. &nbsp;In fact, it probably could be used to document the C# version as well as the Java version, although I haven't taken a look at that for a while. &nbsp;Next, I would like to give some more code examples of how you use it - as always, any suggestions welcome.
