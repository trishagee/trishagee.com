I think the statement that struck me the most when I was on the Certified Scrum Master course was:&nbsp;<em>the start of the project is when you know the least about what you're doing</em>.<br /><br />Which of course is absolutely true.<br /><br />So why do we come up with extensive requirements, detailed design, and fixed plans at this point&nbsp;of time?&nbsp; We haven't put anything into place yet, we haven't played with the code, the customer hasn't seen anything of what we're promising to deliver.<br /><br />If we think about it this way, suddenly the waterfall method makes even less sense (assuming people&nbsp;do still like to work this way).<br /><br />How many times have you just played with a bit of code, done a prototype, a "hello world", knocked up a basic screen, before you can even give your manager some finger-in-the-air estimates?&nbsp; I don't know about you but I'm not comfortable unless I have played a bit to get the feel of something before even looking at someone who asks those questions!<br /><br />The empirical approach makes a lot more sense to me.&nbsp; So why aren't we doing it more?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Because it's harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I think it's harder because it works, but I daren't make such a bold claim without having a number of such projects under my own belt, or at the very least digging through the web to find examples.&nbsp; Which frankly I'll leave to you to do, if it matters to you.
