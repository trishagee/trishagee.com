You know how I keep banging on about attracting different types of people into programming? &nbsp;You know how we say we need to get them young?<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RaFaSj1Hmp8/UZzTIAf5HOI/AAAAAAAALkE/U2662Y01VFE/s1600/2013-05-21+13.56.09.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RaFaSj1Hmp8/UZzTIAf5HOI/AAAAAAAALkE/U2662Y01VFE/s640/2013-05-21+13.56.09.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />The induction covers stuff that I've already talked about here - like why you should do this and what teachers, students and ambassadors get out of it - and some basic dos and don'ts for working with kids. &nbsp;Nothing too scary, and even though I've done this before I found it useful and made me more keen to be involved. &nbsp;The minimal commitment is one event a year, and this can even be something you've arranged yourself (like going into your own kids' school). &nbsp;And although I've signed up for the London area, it's not necessarily geographically constrained - one of the ideas I liked the most is taking kids for a Skype tour around your office, showing where you work, how you work, etc. &nbsp;I think that will help blow away some of the preconceptions around programmers anti-socially sitting in their own rooms hacking out lines of code, for example.<br /><br />You'll notice the rather lovely drawings littering this post. &nbsp;The first exercise we did in the induction was to draw a stereotypical scientist, technologist, engineer, and&nbsp;mathematician. &nbsp;The point of being an ambassador is to help combat these stereotypes, giving kids real role models to look to, people who can help them see what's out there for them. <br /><br />These kids don't necessarily want to be Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.<br /><br />Some of them want to be just like you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
