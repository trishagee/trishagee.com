<div class="p1">I'm a great believer in getting kids to code early - after all, I'm of that generation that was taught&nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/trishagee/6702297.js"></script> <br /><div class="p1">at the age of 9.&nbsp; There are quite a few approaches to teaching today's kids in an engaging way, but I'm a bit wary of the sandbox solutions that teach kids things like how to navigate a virtual thingie around the screen, or lets them create things in a limited virtual world.&nbsp; I don't think kids will easily make the leap between these sort of games to seeing the full potential of programming - they're too limited and have no context for the kids. &nbsp;It's just another game.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Kids need to understand how programming fits into their world, they need to understand the context of coding, if they're going to fall in love with it.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I like <a href="http://www.codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/">Jason Gorman</a>'s comparison of programming to music.&nbsp; Most people learn an instrument because they want to make the sort of music they hear on the radio.&nbsp; But you give them a recorder and teach them to play "snug as a bug in a rug" and they go off the idea entirely.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><blockquote>"So, is this a sexy tune, Mrs. Badcrumble? I just donâ€™t think, Mrs. Badcrumble, that this is really gonna be a sexy tune.". </blockquote></div><div class="p1"><div style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065HKFW/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00065HKFW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trissramb-20">Eddie Izzard - Definite Article</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00065HKFW" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /></div></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Similarly, you give kids a sandbox environment specifically to learn programming for the sake of programming, and they're not going to see how this turns into Facebook or Google or the apps on their phones.&nbsp; They're going to continue seeing computer programs as something that magicians in a land far, far away made just for them.&nbsp; The same way breakfast cereal is grown in box only for them.&nbsp; They don't see programming as something <i>they</i>&nbsp;can do, they don't see the computer as something they can influence.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Just the slightest hint, the slightest push, to show them that they can be the magician, that they can have power over this world. That's the way in.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Many of my generation of programmers learnt by coding those godawful choose-your-own adventure games.&nbsp; They weren't pretty or elegant, but in a single lesson we learnt that a short magic incantation could create something that looked like those games we played.&nbsp; With a bit of persistence we could truly create our <i>own</i>&nbsp;adventure, with a story that we created, not just follow someone else's paths.&nbsp; And then we could inflict that on our little sisters.&nbsp; It was such a short distance from the BBC command line to a game that many of us saw what programming could create, and that programming was something we could do.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">There's an argument these days that computers got so complicated, so elegant, so perfected, that "kids these days" don't have that.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">This is not true.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">It's just not.&nbsp; Don't be fooled by this.&nbsp; Sure, PCs in the 1990s made it more tricky to simply program the thing.&nbsp; And IDEs felt, to those of us who learnt from a blinking prompt, like cheating somehow.&nbsp; Or, at the very least, they divorced us from the internals of the machine, provided us with too much separation (what nonsense, by the way - an IDE must be much closer to the command line than&nbsp; BASIC is from ones and zeros).</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">But those days are waaay behind us.&nbsp; Several more levels of indirection later, and actually it's much <i>easier</i>&nbsp;to write something that gives the immediate feedback, something that has real context, that will help kids get it.&nbsp; This will help kids see <i>why</i>.&nbsp; They're the same as us, they can't just be expected to do it <i>because,</i>&nbsp;they want to know what's the point.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">And these days it's easier. You've got:</div><div class="p1"></div><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a></li><li><a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a></li><li><a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx">Lego mindstorms</a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> games</li><li><a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> plugins</li><li><a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">Android apps</a></li></ul>To name but a few. &nbsp;That's not even including the fact that you can get coding web pages and python code pretty quickly and see instant feedback, or even use an IDE to create a UI in something like C#.<br /><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The first three items in the list are great for people who are very touchy-feely, who want to see something in the real world.&nbsp; Can you imagine how exciting it would be for your kid to see that they wrote a program that closes the curtains?&nbsp; It's a tiny, stupid thing, but you just gave them control of the physical world they live in.&nbsp; Let their imagination do the rest.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The other ideas are probably more directly related to the stuff they use the computer for.&nbsp; You're really providing them with a way to customise the tools they already use.&nbsp; Who doesn't want to imprint a bit of themselves on the virtual world?&nbsp; These sorts of thing let them control a world they understand - in the context of a tool they know (e.g. Facebook), they create a game or a plugin or whatever that works within that world.&nbsp; And they start to see that this tool they use to talk to their friends, this tool that is there to fill their spare time, is something <i>they</i>&nbsp;can control.&nbsp; Maybe they'll start small, but they'll soon learn that everything they use, everything they touch on the computer, is really only code that some other human has built.&nbsp; They'll start to see that the computer-machine is influenceable, that they can tell it to do stuff and it will do it.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">That is addictive.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">That's what we want.&nbsp; We want to open their minds to how their world is constructed, and show them that they can influence it. They can control it. &nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><br /><div class="p1">They can change the world.<br /><br /></div>
