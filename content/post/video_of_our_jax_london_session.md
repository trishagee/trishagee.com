At <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/">JAX London</a> Mike and I presented "Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner's Guide to Hardcore Concurrency". &nbsp;This is the session we <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/10/mike-and-i-debut-our-new-disruptor.html">initially previewed</a> to the London Java Community a few weeks earlier. &nbsp;The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. &nbsp;At JAX, we were up on stage, which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.<br /><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DCdGlxBbKU4" width="560"></iframe></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div>We received some really great feedback on this presentation, and it was brilliant to see a lot of the speakers from JAX there watching us.</div>
