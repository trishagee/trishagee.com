Hot on the heels of my very first <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/my-first-official-mongodb-appearance.html">MongoDB webinar,</a>&nbsp;I was... encouraged... to do another. &nbsp;Here at <a href="http://www.10gen.com/">10gen</a> we've been running a <a href="http://www.10gen.com/presentations?application=154&amp;programming_lang=All&amp;speaker=&amp;event=&amp;language=All">series of webinars</a> around using MongoDB in the financial services domain. &nbsp;Yesterday was the last in the series, and was presented in association with <a href="http://www.c24.biz/">C24</a>&nbsp;- <a href="https://twitter.com/jtdavies">John Davies</a>, their CTO, did most of the talking, and demonstrated their product for automatically turning financial messages from one format into another.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.11NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzNTQ3MDI5OTY3MDMmcHQ9MTM1NDcwMzAwMTcwMSZwPSZkPSZnPTImbz*1YzY5N2U3NzliYTc*ODk3YWExOGFlZjQx/MGYzODA5NiZvZj*w.gif" style="height: 0px; visibility: hidden; width: 0px;" width="0" /><object allowfullscreen="true" allownetworking="all" allowscriptaccess="always" data="http://www.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/1_jiqyo6hd/uiconf_id/48501" height="330" id="kaltura_player_1354702995" name="kaltura_player_1354702995" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowNetworking" value="all" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000" /><param name="movie" value="http://www.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/1_jiqyo6hd/uiconf_id/48501"/><param name="flashVars" value=""/><a href="http://corp.kaltura.com">video platform</a><a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_management">video management</a><a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/solutions/video_solution">video solutions</a><a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_publishing">video player</a></object></div><i>(Slides and webinar <a href="http://www.10gen.com/presentations/webinar-processing-high-volume-data-feeds-mongodb-fix-fpml-and-swift-association-c24">available here</a> - and you're not going deaf, the sound doesn't start until about 3:44 into the video)</i><br /><br /><br />It was a fun webinar to do, actually - I didn't know anything about <a href="http://www.c24.biz/io-mongodb.html">C24's iO</a> tool, so I learnt quite a lot as I watched John navigate the demo. &nbsp;My background in trying to debug raw <a href="http://www.fixprotocol.org/FIXimate3.0/">FIX</a> messages probably skewed my questions, I was definitely more interested in how to use it as a developer and what it could give me if I were doing production support. &nbsp;It's a dead interesting tool - I know for a fact that many organisations, banks in particular, spend a lot of time translating stuff from one format to another, before making some decision on on what to do with the contents. &nbsp;This tool does all the heavy lifting so you can get on with the interesting stuff, the stuff your business actually needs you to do.<br /><br />In addition, as someone with more of an FS background than a <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/nosql-is-stupid-name.html">NoSQL</a> background, I was very interested to hear how lots of the financial institutions are using <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> already - the combination of not having an enforced schema but supporting structured data, supported by fast execution, makes it a good fit for a lot of the problems they're trying to solve. &nbsp;Yes, it's my job to say nice things about MongoDB, but when businesses are already using it because it makes their lives easier and meets their needs, it gives you a warm fuzzy feeling that the product must be doing something right.<br /><br />I enjoyed giving this webinar, I think if I do any more I will suggest pairing on it (we all know two heads are better than one, right?) - it gives you some of the feedback and energy that's hard to get in a darkened room talking to a microphone.
