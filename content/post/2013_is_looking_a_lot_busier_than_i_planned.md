So, despite promising myself that I would only do one event a month for the rest of this year, looks like I'm going to be a bit busier than that.<br /><div><br /></div><div>In case you're wondering what I'm up to (or, even better, hoping to see me talk or meet me), here are my confirmed engagements:<br /><br />15-17 May - <a href="http://2013.geecon.org/conference-day-two">GeeCon</a>, Poland<br />18-20 June - <a href="http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2013/presentation/A%20Fluent%20API%20for%20Java%20and%20MongoDB">GOTO Amsterdam</a> - whole day tutorial on the new (unfinished) MongoDB Java driver.<br />24th June - <a href="http://www.stacresearch.com/spring2013LON">STAC Summit</a>, London - something MongoDB-shaped (i.e. not Java-specific)<br />27th June - <a href="http://thettn.tv/headlines/trisha-gee-27th-june-2013-video.aspx#.UYzlwv35XAE.blogger">Technology Transformation Network</a>, London<br />1-5th July - In Dublin, hoping to talk to a MUG or JUG while I'm there.<br />22-25th July - <a href="http://www.oracle.com/events/apac/cn/en/javaone/index.html">JavaOne Shanghai</a> (CON1148). So excited to go to China!<br />August - Looks like I'm going to be in Spain a couple of times (Madrid/Seville).<br />11-12th Sept - Love to go to JavaZone, Oslo. &nbsp;We'll see.<br />22-26 Sept - <a href="http://javafx.steveonjava.com/congrats-to-the-1st-javaone-invitees/">JavaOne</a>, San Francisco.<br />30th Sept - 2nd Oct - <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/presentation/Career%20Advice%20for%20Programmers">GOTO Aarhus</a> - very pleased I can make it this year!<br />17-18th Oct - <a href="http://gotocon.com/berlin-2013/speakers/">GOTO Berlin</a>.<br />28-30th Oct - <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/">JAX London</a>.<br />December - <a href="http://www.yowconference.com.au/index.html">YOW Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney</a> - Australia. &nbsp;I've never been to Oz, I can't wait!</div><div><br /></div><div>If you've either clicked through those, or you've already been stalking my talks, you'll see I haven't actually made up my mind what to call this year's main presentation:</div><div><ol><li>What do you mean, Backwards Compatibility?</li><li>Design is a process, not an artefact</li><li>Design is a process, not a document</li></ol></div><div>This is mostly because when I signed up for some of these conferences, I thought I was going to be talking about how hard it was to write backwardly-compatible libraries (which it is). &nbsp;But when I wrote the presentation, it turned out to be about software design. &nbsp;And then I found out artefact/artifact can be spelt two ways, ho hum.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm still not sure yet if this will actually be the same (but evolving) talk under two different guises, or if they are two subtly different talks. &nbsp;I guess we'll see what I end up writing the week before I'm due to present "Design is a process, not a document".</div>
