Yesterday I had the privilege of presenting the very first session for [vJUG](http://www.meetup.com/virtualJUG/), a new virtual Java User Group that allows us to span
geographies when sharing talks and stories. I'm really interested in the vJUG idea, especially now I'm not in London - if we can find
good ways to share knowledge without having to travel, that will help us reach people who don't normally go to conferences or don't have
a local user group to go to. Not to mention cutting travel costs and saving the environment.

See the event, and the record of the IRC chat, here:

The slides are also online, but obviously they're part of the video as well:
