Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example,
by [creating CVs that don't suck](/post/how_to_make_your_cv_not_suck/), and by [staying ahead of the curve](/post/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/)),
[Dave Thomas](http://www.davethomas.net/) asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon
.com/video#36), a talk I wasn't enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short
time.  Dave seemed to like something in it though, as he gave me the opportunity to present the topic again at YOW last December,
and this time I think I managed to distill the important points into the (still ridiculously short) time allotted.

[See the video here](http://yow.eventer.com/yow-2013-1080/career-advice-for-programmers-by-trisha-gee-1380),
and please give me any feedback you have.

I recognise there are many many more topics I could cover, so I'd better start making a list.  Suggestions?
