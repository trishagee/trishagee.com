YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at [GeeCON](http://vimeo.com/72982916) and [DevoxxUK](http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about),
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.
