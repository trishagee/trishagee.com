At [JAX London](http://jaxlondon.com/) Mike and I presented "Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner's Guide to Hardcore Concurrency".
This is the session we [initially previewed](http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/10/mike-and-i-debut-our-new-disruptor.html) to the
London Java Community a few weeks earlier. The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the
venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage,
which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.

We received some really great feedback on this presentation, and it was brilliant to see a lot of the speakers from JAX there watching us.
