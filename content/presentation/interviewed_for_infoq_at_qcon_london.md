I was flattered to be [interviewed for InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-disruptor) at QCon London. It was a fun interview actually,
and didn't feel anything like the half an hour it actually took. In it, I get to talk about Agile at LMAX, the Disruptor (of course) and diversity in IT (again).
