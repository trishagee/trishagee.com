## Mentoring
<a href="http://graduatedevelopercommunity.wordpress.com/2012/02/18/gdc-meet-a-mentor/">Meet a Mentor</a> - mentor undergraduates/graduates in London(ish). Always looking for mentors of any experience level

## Networking<
<a href="http://www.java.net/jugs/java-user-groups">JUGs</a> and other user groups - join a local JUG! There's no better way to meet people who can mentor you, and influence you own peers. Being part of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/">London Java Community</a> literally changed my life.

Attend and/or speak at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/topics/java/">events and conferences</a>
