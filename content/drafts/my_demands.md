<div>So now I have been spoiled. &nbsp;If you want me to come to your conference, the bar has been set high and my list of demands is as follows:</div><div><ul><li>Accommodation should be arranged for me. &nbsp;Flights too if possible.</li><li>I must be with a group of amazing speakers, and not only given a speakers' dinner, but multiple other chances to be flung together with these interesting people</li><li>We should be able to bring husbands, wives, kids, brothers, parents, best friends with us to the conference</li><li>I need a MiFi device so that I don't rack up ridiculous international data fees.</li><li>Your conference should be during the summer, and will ideally include a boat cruise for all the speakers.</li></ul><div>Not much then.</div><div><br /></div></div>
