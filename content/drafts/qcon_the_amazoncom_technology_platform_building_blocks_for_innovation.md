<div class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=139">Werner Vogels, Amazon.com CTO</a> (<span class="ljuser" lj:user="allthingsdistri" style="white-space: nowrap;"></span><b><a href="http://syndicated.livejournal.com/allthingsdistri/"><b>allthingsdistri</b></a>)</b></div><br />- Amazon = technology platform not simply an e-commerce website<br />- 2 main strategies: 1) "Data Integration" 2) Services<br />- The amazon site isn't just about e-commerce, the community drives it.&nbsp; Reviews etc help drive purchase decisions.&nbsp; This extends to all product types - the (currently US-only) engineering section includes reviews on springs and screws etc.&nbsp; Community views on these products is just as important as those on more "subjective" products like music and films.<br />Sharing &amp; Invitation<br />&nbsp;- Coulnd't have grown without inviting other sellers<br />&nbsp;- if you can't sell it just yet, you might as well get someone else to sell it on your platform.&nbsp; I suppose at least then you start to build a rep as somewhere to go to for those items<br />- You can always compete even if you're both using the same platform.&nbsp; Amazon don't lose, the user's are still going there, and they will compare a variety of factors other than just price: time to delivery, trustworthyness of seller; availability<br />- <a href="http://musicplasma.com/">MusicPlasma </a>uses google info / platform in a way that was never imagined, which just shows if you open stuff up when you can't do something, you can potentially get an awful lot back = innovation<br /><br />Techniques for using Amazon:<br />- Offer your products on amazon, and also create your own site which is a simple veneer over the amazon site<br /><br />- Amazon take XML feeds of products and info &amp; saves.&nbsp; Not unlike KeyInvest.&nbsp; One wonders if the amazon framework could be reused to create KeyInvest<br />- E-commerce organisation != software vendor<br />- I was wrong about my approach to TC's "let'd add this because client A wants it" - this can lead to market-driven improvements that other clients might want, and things that you&nbsp; might not have thought of.&nbsp; However I still feel this needs careful management, most especially because you need to understand what the client REALLY wants.<br />- The example for the above point was Mothercare and M&amp;S being "real" shops with an amazon site, requiring amazon to support Point of Sale points inside stores.&nbsp; This becomes a real selling point.<br /><br />Amazon have 5 main services:<br />- ID management<br />- Orders and payment (inc. dealing with fraud)<br />- Fulfillment and customer services (delivery &amp; returns?)<br />- Products &amp; offers management<br />- Content generation / searching<br /><br />- Obidos is the old amazon system - just got rid of it last year (I think) after 7 years of trying to shift away from it<br />- Framework doesn't allow you to access the DB directly, you have to go through some sort of data access layer which enables you to put some logic (and security?) around that access<br />- No wall between development and operations.&nbsp; Dev get stung by their own bugs (3am phonecalls) which incentivises them to fix them.&nbsp; However they are actually given time to fix them which is one of the important points.<br />- Lots of systems (homegrown in particular) have a 70%/30% split - 70% of the time is spent on maintenance / infrastructure / every day issues.&nbsp; Only 30% is spent on the things which differentiate you.&nbsp; You should hand over the mundane shit to someone who's already worked on and developed this stuff (e.g. Amazon) so you can focus on your key business.<br />- <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000567.html">Getting Real</a> - can't remember what he said about this book but it does look useful<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000567.html"></a>
