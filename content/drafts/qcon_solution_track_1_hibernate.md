<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=199"> Nicolas Brasseur</a>, <a href="http://www.javablackbelt.com/">JavaBlackBelt</a><br /><br />- This was a very basic introduction into Hibernate and what it's about<br />- It was also a session aimed at promoting the JavaBlackBelt site, a little bit about what it does.&nbsp; I.e. it's free certifications<br />- I was under the impression the material was available on the website but I can't find it<br />- I didn't find this session particularly useful because it was too slow and too basic.&nbsp; I would like to see the material from the session availble somewhere but buggered if I can find it.<br />- Good to see I actually passed the basic Java SE test.&nbsp; Might be worth keeping your hand in with these certifications, I've already forgotten a bunch of the sun certification.
