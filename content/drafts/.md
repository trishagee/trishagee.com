The last 24 hours have been brought to me via "Women in Technology". &nbsp;Again.<br /><br />Yesterday I had the genuine pleasure of seeing a couple of people talking about the new NASA Mars mission to girls aged 11-16. &nbsp;I was really impressed by the sorts of questions asked by the girls - it showed their extreme interest in the subject, and a deep knowledge of science &amp; technology, particular when applied to space travel, that I hadn't anticipated. <br /><br />It made a lie of the statement that girls aren't interested in science and technology. &nbsp;But the chances are, this is a self-selecting group - girls who are already interested in the area, and/or girls who's parents are encouraging their interest in these subjects. &nbsp;In fact, the organiser said that many girls on these sorts of programs are there because their dad is an engineer of some kind (Take Home Point One: if you have a daughter and you're in a Maths/Science/Tech job, tell your daughters what you do and get them involved). So, while I think these programs are great, and I wish I'd been on one when I was a kid, are they really making any impact on the overall perception of technology and engineering jobs as being For Boys? Or are they just encouraging the ones who were already interested, making us feel like we're doing something to address the gender gap without really making a big difference? &nbsp;We won't be able to answer that question for at least 10 years, so for now we should probably keep doing this good stuff.<br /><br />Then I went to session by the Greenlight for Girls organiser. &nbsp;And while it gave me some food for thought, I think it was xaclty the sort of session I don't want to be running at conferences: there wasn't really any new information (from my point of view I suppose, as someone who's already done a bit of research); it was attended by women, who already know the situation and the issues, and men, who are sympathetic to the cause and, as usual, want to know what they as individuals can do (great!).<br /><br />One of the great things that came out of the session were real, practical solutions - go into schools and show kids (not just girls) what we do and what we're all about; encourage new speakers; and aim to create a more diverse set of role models.<br /><br />One of hte bad things it was another venue for people to talk about some of their bad experiences, and a tendency to over-generalise around "girl" characteristics and "boy" characteristics that don't do either gender any favours - the techy girls in the room think "well I'm not really like that" and the techy guys in the room feel a bit attacked by the negative portrail of their gender. &nbsp;And let's face it, techy guys are really not your typical "guy" guys, if such a thing exists. &nbsp;I've never met a group of men less interested in football, for example.<br /><br />Another bad thing (in my mind) is quotas. &nbsp;But we need the data<br /><br />There was a comment about women role models again, and what I'd really like to see is the data to back up women needing women role models. &nbsp;Actually I'll be happy if I see data stating that women role models encourages a different variety of people, including boys.<br /><br /><br />So I wonder - will anyone pay me to do some research into the area? &nbsp;It would be awesome to have time and resources to gather real data to allow us to start tackling the issues in a more scientific way.<br /><div><br /></div><br /><br />So, I think we came out of the session feeling simultaneously frustrated and also content to leave some of the work to organisations like Greenlight for Girls - great! &nbsp;They're doing stuff about the problem! &nbsp;Back to the day job...<br /><br />I had a number of other interesting conversations with guys throughout the day (mostly fathers) too.<br /><br /><br />Then today at 1pm UK-time - 5am PST, eeeeek, I need a lot of coffee to get through today - there was a Remarkable Women Twitter Party. &nbsp;I had fun, and it was really great to "meet" lots of interesting women. &nbsp;I was a bit alarmed at some of the stereotypes that were bandied around ("men" this and "women" that), and I think one of the things we need to do is get a handle on this. &nbsp;I think by over generalising we do more harm than good, especially as I think we got here by marketing liking to lump us in buckets so they can sell crap to us. &nbsp;But by imagining these buckets they create them and solidify them. &nbsp;If you want an exaple of this you only need to go into a kids store to see the plethora of pink, then see the girls cry out asking for more pink - but only because they;ve been programmed to want it to fit in with the clan they think they belong to.<br /><br />The interesting thing about these stereotypes is that if you challenge them, quite often you will find multiple examples of people who do not fit the stereotype mould. &nbsp;Boys in IT don't really like football. &nbsp;Girls who don't like pink. &nbsp;Women who aren't that great at being peopley. &nbsp;Men who love to gossip.<br /><br />Stereotypes are dead useful to us as humans. &nbsp;We bucket things that look the same shape together for evolutionary reasons. &nbsp;"Yummy stuff", "warm places", "things with big pointy teeth that will eat me"<br /><br /><br /><br />""25% of assholes' targets quit; 20% of WITNESSES quit.
