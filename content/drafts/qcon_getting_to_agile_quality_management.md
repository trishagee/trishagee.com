<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=176"> Andreas Schliep</a>, Scrum Master, SPRiNT iT<br /><br />- This is the first event I attended on Friday due to forgetting to set my alarm and having to pickup the car.&nbsp; Plus I was still drunk<br />- Problem with Agile teams is frequently there's no management and no single point of contact<br />- If you have an agile team, do they have the skills for testing?<br />- "Testing Maturity Model" like CMM - 5 levels<br />- So far talk sounded like a sales pitch for a QA team.&nbsp; I get that agile people tend not to be bought into this but I SO am.<br />- "Help customer &amp; team write acceptance tests" - So they need to be involved early and not after the code is delivered.&nbsp; No chucking it over the wall here<br />- "Quality Engineers" not testers.&nbsp; collaboration with dev, working with continuous integration, etc<br />- Agile testing yahoo newsgroup<br />- When do we do testing?<br />- Are we talking about parallel?&nbsp; Velocity should cater for time to fix bugs<br />- Can we release to UAT every iteration, or should we wait?<br />- Alternating sprints - 1 pure dev, 1 integration testing (was this my idea or something he said?)<br />- Developers and testers are one team<br />- Testers help developers write good unit tests<br />- Bugs feed into product backlog and don't drop off the radar because they're a different breed and / or you haven't allocated specific time for it.
