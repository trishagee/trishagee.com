<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=165"> Boris Gloger</a>, Founder of SPRINT-iT, Germany<br /><br />How to run a retrospective:<br />- It's about learning<br />- Security is v. important - no blame; everyone tried their hardest<br />- No management, no business, so again there's no blame and full security:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - What does this mean for teams like ours with a combination of companies working on them?&nbsp; Will we feel "safe" exposing our weaknesses to permies and other consultancy firms?<br />- 1st create timeline with postits of events that happened over the iteration<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - FACTS only<br />- 2nd is Things We Did Well - it's importnat to separate this out and get the team into a good, optimistic mood<br />- 3rd What Could be Improved (NOT "where we fucked up")<br />- Feedback items (TODOs) that come out of these sessions need to be prioritised like any product updates.<br />- Impediment backlog is organisational changes that need to be made.<br />- Note that out of these, personal items get the same priorities as technical items - the team IS the people so it's importnat to recgonise the whole picture.<br />- Visibility is key - if there issues and conflicts etc these need to be aired.&nbsp; <br />- Trust is mandatory in Agile?&nbsp; If you can't trust the person who's running your team (manager or whatever) you're screwed<br />- Main point: Agile / scrum is totally dependent upon it's people, the team - it seems in particular the leader<br />- Timeline is important because it gives you perspective on what you achieved.&nbsp; Which will probably be a lot more than you realise.&nbsp; Why are people so pesimistic?<br />- If you as scrum master remove impediments you get the response of the team.&nbsp; This dude says clear three items every iteration and the team will love you forever.
