Importance of testing and why people don't do it enough using too many tools, integration, different release dates predictable, repeatable firms forget about bursts  --- "capital markets"  tibco ftl high performance, low latency fully compliant with jms software based  HP trading group in NYC  busy slides from cisco  Really love the timeboxed vendor talks  --- Intel Advanced Vector Extentions more per clock do more per nanojoule three operand instruction format fused multiply/add - less rounding.  better for doubles? gather 8 floats from memory intel parallel studio C++ examples :) how do we get this at the java level? horrible slides intel software enables it one other girl  -- total view debugger, desinged for multi-threaded and multi-processor CUDA non-deterministic bugs are the bain of developers' lives step backwards into code as easily as forwards interesting content, almost train-sportter-standard presentation skills  Oregano clock synchronisation academia and r&d ptp statistics, measuring  solarflare ptp jitter caused by queuing  symmetricom precision vs accurate rported accuracy vs measured accuracy temperature cahnges grossly affect accuracy oscialtors are great thermometers  fsm labs linux time can go backwards?? reliability is key  --- Time Sync for oyr time clocks wander, you don't know if your discrepancy is the network or your clock why does this accurate & precise time matter? "Tamper with time"  gaming time might be a good way to game trading speed of your network will improve the timing  --- Latency - more than just a number profile is important outliers seems unusually nervous for a produce manager distribution represents what's really happening, represents your risk better  another explanation of accuracy vs precision  --- infancy etc Should we really be rolling our own latency monitoring? mmm, two good looking guys on the panel! having stats,, a pretty pie chart, but not doing anything about it is pointless some of the smaller shops are better at leveraging the info suspicion of vendors, that maybe they can't deliver what you need in production? is this because they're not savvy enough to understand what they're getting? action of observing changes what you;re observing metrics are applicable for different teams - they need their different views alternatively there's standardisation competitors collaborating to work out standards is an indication of how important this is universal protocol that fix can use? first thing you need to decide is your objective before you can measure anything
