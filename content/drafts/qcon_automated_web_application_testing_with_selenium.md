You can factor out the common code (like logging in) so when you change something like the name of login box you only have to make a code change in one place and not re-record the whole thing.<br />- Or even if you don't manage to modularise it well, at least it's code so you can do search/replace or an IDE refactor<br />- The recorder is used to create the reusable code snippets - dev still have to do a bunch of work.<br />- These are NOT unit tests.&nbsp; OK you can run them in JUnit but this is misleading. If the DB isn't there or the login fails, everything breaks.&nbsp; These are integration/functional tests.<br />- Instead of recording everything, you can poke the code behind the scenes if necessary - some of your reusable stuff in particular might not need to rely upon going through the web front-end, you can poke the values directly in the DB or grab them from a DAO if this reduces the fragility of some of the tests.&nbsp; For e.g. you could use the DAO to poke test data into the DB (instead of going through setup web pages) then test the stuff that relies upon the data (e.g. search).<br />- You can do this direct manipulation because your tests are actually java and not just recorded front-end clicks.<br />- Probably best not to start and stop the whole thing on setup and tear down, because these are expensive operations and of course setup/teardown are run for every test.&nbsp; Since this is not real unit testing we might get away with one session for the whole lot.&nbsp; Still, caution required with this approach, could be polluting the session state or browser cookies with stateful tests.
