<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=201">Frederic Baumann</a>, <a href="http://www.ilog.com/">ILOG</a><br /><br />- I just had to spend 5 minutes talking to Neil to remind myself of this presentation.&nbsp; I guess it didn't make that much of an impression on me<br />- The dude spent the session doing a bunch of coding to write a little Ajax application.&nbsp; I think, if I recall correctly, that he proved it was a lot faster than just reloading all the page the whole time.<br />- He said about 50% of projects are web-based and this is growing, but I'm wondering from my own experience if people are starting to think that maybe going backwards in functionality to provide a global application isn't worth it, and that Ajax-style hacks to make the web actually usable are, in fact, the wrong approach and we should be moving back to client-server, .NET front-end type things.<br />- The Ajax demonstrated was not dissimilar to the work Brent and I did on Dragon.<br />- Ajax is cool and looks like it could be fun to get working.&nbsp; Not to mention all the little things you could use it for that we just haven't thought about (it's not just about clever drop-down lists on input boxes)<br />- After hearing the others rave about the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> I'm thinking maybe that might be the way to go.&nbsp; At the very least I'd like to see if I can get my hands on the QCon presentation for that, and a copy of the toolkit, and have a play.<br />- I thought about adding some Ajax to a maint tool, but then that just becomes yet another quirk to be aware of and maintain.
