OK, here we go again.&nbsp; It's been a while, but something else kicked off a rant on the women-in-technology "problem".<br /><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Firstly, I want to re-iterate what I hope has been my central theme all along: focussing on the "Women" bit is completely wrong</div><div class="p1"></div><ol type="a"><li>That's 50% of the <i>entire world's population</i>&nbsp;you've just lumped together there. 3.5 billion people obviously all think, feel, and behave in the same way and are impacted by exactly the same issues (hint: This Is A Lie).</li><li>What about the other missing minorities?&nbsp; And let's not forget that in IT the minorities include people like the sports jock and wanna-be doctors and lawyers (this might be a Good Thing).</li><li>Why do you want a c)?&nbsp; Isn't a) and b) enough?</li></ol><div class="p1">Secondly, and I've usually ignored this bit, because otherwise I'll rant and just dilute the primary message (see above): "in Technology" is a <i>tiny</i>&nbsp;bit vague.&nbsp; It's even worse when you talk about women in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields">STEM</a> - surely there must be some cross-over between "caring" jobs like nursing and science?&nbsp; Don't they need some interest in medical "stuff"?&nbsp; And the sheer number of women accountants (they still have challenges at the senior level, but at entry-level there are now more women accountants than men) must somewhat skew the STE<i>Mathematics</i>&nbsp;figures a little.<br /><br />I wandered off again, where was I?&nbsp; Yes, technology.&nbsp; The women I know who studied computer science at university (my friends and colleagues) are still in "technology" - they're technical project managers, technical writers, business analysts.&nbsp; Maybe just under half (of my <i>extremely</i>&nbsp;small sample size of 7, but then there never were that many of us) are programmers.&nbsp; All of them (except one, who after more than 10 years in technology has gone off to start a diving school in Thailand, and who would blame here?) are still "in technology".&nbsp; I bet 86% of the men who were on my computer science course aren't still in tech, and I can almost guarantee that less than 43% of them are programmers over 10 years after graduation.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">So.&nbsp; While women may not necessarily leave their computer science degree and become programmers (and I've usually focused on the "issues" of the lack of women programmers specifically), it's entirely possible that a higher percentage of the women with Computer Science degrees are pursuing a really technical career like programming than the men.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Where does this leave us? Back at the same place it always did: we have a lack of women in technical roles in the sorts of companies we work for - my last not-very-scientific poll of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/">London Java Community</a> puts the numbers somewhere at around 15%-ish.&nbsp; We actually have less women studying computer science, around 10%-ish, depending where you are.&nbsp; So, once again, focusing our efforts on the issues facing these women in the workplace is a waste of time.&nbsp; Yes, the absolute number of women in IT is still declining, but I think the number of men is not really doing much better.&nbsp; And besides, with the small numbers we're talking about, a few women finding something better to do is going to look bad in the statistics, but not necessarily point to an underlying trend.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">So we're doing it wrong.&nbsp; Still.</div><div class="p1"><br /><ul><li>Do I have to say it again?&nbsp; The pink, people, the pink.&nbsp; I don't care if you like pink.&nbsp; I don't care if you have statistics to prove it appeals to 80% of your audience.&nbsp; I don't care if it's your corporate colour.&nbsp; By now, you should know not to brand any women in tech / women developers initiative with pink.&nbsp; Please don't.&nbsp; I am not a barbie.&nbsp; I do not want to be a barbie.&nbsp; I am not 5 years old.&nbsp; I reserve the right to wear pink and paint my nails pink if I wish, but I do not wish to be BRANDED pink.&nbsp; It's lumping me back in with the other 3.5 billion people and <i>I don't want to be one of them</i>.&nbsp; I'm a Trish, I'm a me, I'm not just A Girl.</li><li>I admire the initiatives to reach out to women in their careers, to help them find help and to create networks and foster mentoring.&nbsp; I have benefitted from all of that - not through women-only initiatives, but through corporate and community initiatives that help <i>everyone</i>&nbsp;get on in their careers, if they want it.&nbsp; Let's not separate the women out for special treatment.&nbsp; Do I need special treatment?&nbsp; Am I that stupid or that disadvantaged?&nbsp; Just because I have two X chromosomes?&nbsp; In the current "man's world" and the current society that was <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/08/why-do-so-many-incompetent-men/">shaped to reward certain male-ish</a> characteristics, we are at a social disadvantage.&nbsp; But don't point that out, that just makes younger women think they'll have to work harder than the men, that they're starting from further back, that they are going to have to change themselves to get ahead.&nbsp; And if I thought that when I was a young woman, I would have though "why bother?".&nbsp; That all may be true (or it may not).&nbsp; But sometimes we don't want to tell people how high they'll have to climb or how far they'll have to run in advance, the human brain will try and prevent them from even starting that journey.</li></ul></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">So with those two things in mind, take a look at:</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

By pointing out we're different, we feel different.&nbsp; Constantly feeling different, and <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">feeling like an impostor</a>, is exhausting.&nbsp; Feeling like you have to fight the battle for your own equality is distracting from getting on with the job.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">There are some issues, I'm not denying it - you do get looked at differently, and people will point out to you that you're a women (in my experience this has almost always been a positive thing, a comment that it's great to have a woman doing this job and where can we get more from?&nbsp; But it's still pointing out your difference).&nbsp; But if we could spend a little less time trying to work out what's so different about the women that they're scared off (it's because they're not interested in technology; it's because they have kids; it's because they want to work part time; it's because they don't want to sit in a dark room and eat pizza - I've heard all of these <i>from women</i>&nbsp;who don't fall into any of these categories) and spend a little more time highlighting the things that draw us together, the things that will attract young people of ALL backgrounds into this challenging, fun, innovative, creative, logical, and frequently-well-paid industry, I think you'll find the lack-of-diversity problem gradually start to fade away.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Let's try it for a change. &nbsp;</div>
