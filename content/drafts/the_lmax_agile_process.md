Not surprisingly, we often get asked in interview what our development process is. &nbsp;Actually, we get asked at conferences too, but developers are most interested.<br /><br />I describe it as a blend of Lean and Scrum with XP practices. &nbsp;It's probably not an accurate description but it's and approximation which people can make reasonable assumptions about.<br /><br />The things I think are Lean-ish:<br />&nbsp;- Kanban board<br />&nbsp;- Pull model<br />&nbsp;- Eliminating waste<br /><br />Scrum-like:<br />&nbsp;- 2-week iterations (yes, not exclusively Scrum)<br />&nbsp;- Retrospectives<br />&nbsp;- Iteration Planning Meetings<br />&nbsp;- Product backlog<br /><br />Nicked from XP:<br />&nbsp;- Pair programming<br />&nbsp;- TDD<br />&nbsp;- Continous INtegration++ (i.e. Continuous Delivery)<br />&nbsp;- Collective code ownership<br /><br /><br />Plus we try and take some of these things further - for example acceptance, system and performance tests. &nbsp;We're also very interested in Domain Driven Design, personally I think that's to try and balance the micro-design you can get when doing TDD.
