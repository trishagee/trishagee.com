<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=159"> Rachel Davies</a>, Agile Alliance Chair<br /><br />- Didn't find this session all that useful since it was quite high-level stuff about Agile<br />- Don't forget continuous integration and short iteration cycles means you can QA pretty much whenever you want<br />- I wrote "maybe Natalie should go on an Agile course", having spoken to Amit she's already said she's happy to do the training on this kind of thing<br />- Maybe KI should do group estimation sessions instead of the way they're currently dished out: a) they will get done, and b) we can all start learning a little more about the system and potentially improve our estimates.<br />- There's no point if KI is to be offshored.&nbsp; Unless we want to use this to push Detica into a position to retain it<br />- Genuine user stories, e.g. "I want to be able to do this" would help people like Stephen and find the business drivers instead of forcing them into our technical language/model.
