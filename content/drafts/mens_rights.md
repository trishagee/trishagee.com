(Usual disclaimer: contains opinion, stereotyping and theory. &nbsp;Some claims may actually be backed up with data.)<br /><br />Boys are discriminated against.<br /><br />I know, that's an unpopular and probably controversial thing to claim. &nbsp;There are substantially <a href="http://www.catalyst.org/publication/282/2008-catalyst-census-of-women-board-directors-of-the-fortune-500">fewer female directors than male ones</a>&nbsp;(and <a href="http://womensgrid.freecharity.org.uk/?p=6381">in Britain numbers have&nbsp;plateaued</a>); on average, <a href="http://www.pay-equity.org/info-time.html">women in full time employment still earn less than men</a> (although <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=167">in the UK the gap is narrowing</a>); women are still<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2005/feb/05/discriminationatwork.troubleatwork"> losing their jobs due to pregnancy</a>; even if there were no discrimination against pregnancy, <a href="http://www.news.com.au/business/business-smarts/women-say-pregnancy-is-a-career-killer/story-e6frfm9r-1225803655626">women still think it will hinder their careers</a>.<br /><br />Decades of feminism has definitely made a dent in gender discrimination, but the general feeling is we still haven't made it, we still don't have equals rights.<br /><br />Something isn't working.<br /><br />A few years back, when I was between jobs and trying to find something else to worry about, I started to think about it. &nbsp;I thought I'd take a step back and look at the bigger picture - remember what your teacher always told you? &nbsp;Go back and re-read the question after you've written your answer, just to check you <i>did</i> answer it.<br /><br />So I thought about the question. &nbsp;Not "why do women face a glass ceiling?" but "why don't we have gender equality?". &nbsp;And it dawned on me that we were approaching it only from one angle: we've been trying to get equality for women in the workplace. &nbsp;A noble, honourable cause, and one which I personally have benefitted from. <br /><br />What were the common complaints around why women still weren't getting the pay they wanted, the promotions they wanted, the working environments they wanted? &nbsp;That<a href="http://www.womenintechnology.co.uk/news/call-for-ban-on-firing-pregnant-women-news-17104174"> pregnancy could leave them without a job</a>, that "<a href="http://www.suite101.com/content/the-glass-ceiling-a23113">employers believe that women will quit to begin a family</a>"; that women need "<a href="http://www.womenintechnology.co.uk/MultiPage.aspx?id=c6c07d19-2442-4ae1-bfa4-2562aecad760">work/life balance and flexible work arrangements</a>".<br /><br />I've been a member of a number of Women in IT groups and attended girl geek events, and I've heard the same things there: women need to take time out for pregnancy and when they're a mother they need flexible working to pick up / drop off kids, to take care of them when they're sick, to attend their plays and sports days.<br /><br />As a 21-year-old, single girl, I didn't care about ANY of that. &nbsp;I cared about how to make my career happen. &nbsp;My parents were teachers and I knew nothing about the business world, and my most pressing problem was how to get a promotion and still stay a developer. &nbsp;This Women in IT group offered me nothing, yet I was a woman in IT.<br /><br />But I know loads of <i>fathers</i> who care about that stuff. &nbsp;Most of them, in fact.<br /><br />We, the women in IT, fell into the trap society had laid for us. &nbsp;We believed these were women's issues, and that what was stopping us in the working world.<br /><br />Well, yeah, maybe it is stopping women in the working world. &nbsp;So women fought damned hard to prove it wasn't going to stop us, that we could have everything. &nbsp;And I've been reading in a lot of places it <a href="http://www.womenintechnology.co.uk/MultiPage.aspx?id=c6c07d19-2442-4ae1-bfa4-2562aecad760">made us miserable</a>.<br /><br />There was a <i>huge</i> missing piece in this puzzle though.<br /><br />What about the men?<br /><br />What about the fathers, the husbands? &nbsp;Were they all really so awful they wanted to do their 40 hours a week, go out for beers with the boys, and let the little woman run around after the kids and do her 40 hours?<br /><br />I'm sure there were men like that. &nbsp;I'm sure there were a lot more at the beginning of the women's movement.<br /><br />But my experience with guys is that they want to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/04/fathers-happier-more-housework-study">share the domestic duties</a>, they want to be equal partners in the relationship. &nbsp;Interestingly, statistics show that couples who share duties on the home front are <a href="http://www.psychologies.co.uk/articles/equally-shared-parenting/">50% less likely to divorce</a>. &nbsp;<i>Fifty percent!</i> &nbsp;That's huge. &nbsp;That's a much more substantial statistic than the difference in the wage gap between men and women.<br /><br /><br />Attacking on the wrong dimension<br /><br />HUmans stereotype and group
