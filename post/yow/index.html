           <p>December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&rsquo;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. &nbsp;A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

It looked at each of the SOLID principles, where they came from, what they are, helped us understand why we need to care about them (or not). &nbsp;It became clear to me that as we become more experienced, as we grow, we need to continually re-visit the things we think we know, or the basics of what we&rsquo;re trying to do, as you&rsquo;ll find things there that surprise you - things you thought you understood, or things that you didn&rsquo;t understand before and now have more context for. &nbsp;In particular, I learnt another argument against using inheritance willy-nilly (one of my current favourite bug-bears)</div><ul><li>Writing software is like writing fiction.</li><li>Experts say &ldquo;it depends&rdquo; because they know a number of rules which might be applicable.</li><li>You can&rsquo;t change <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PublishedInterface.html">published interfaces</a> because other people are dependent upon your code (pretty much the entire basis of my Backwards Compatibility talk), but if you own the code you can change it to your heart&rsquo;s content.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51f116466b93322f4900000f?track=Service+%2F+API+Design&amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au">Creating Observable APIs with Rx</a></div><div>Ben Christensen (<a href="http://twitter.com/benjchristensen">@benjchristensen</a>)</div><div><br /></div><div>Netflix are doing some really amazing stuff with architecture, design and code, and what I love the most is that they&rsquo;re willing to share it with the rest of us.

and a more MongoDB-focussed one, which I reused the original title for. &nbsp;This newer, MongoDB-focussed one is what I gave at GOTO Berlin, and I decided to use this for YOW as it&rsquo;s a technical (ish) talk that goes into some detail about MongoDB, and they do pay my rent.</div><div><br /></div><div>The really great (or possibly, bad) thing about YOW is that because it&rsquo;s the same conference at three venues, only a few days apart, it gives you a chance to put your Lean Startup knowledge into practice - you can experiment, get feedback, and improve. &nbsp;Like the GOTOs/QCons, they have a Green/Yellow/Red feedback system from the audience so you can get a feel for how they liked your talk (the Aussies are a bit non-committal, they were keen on the Yellow button - commit one way or another!! (or don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t want more reds)). &nbsp;So decided to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B test</a> my talk - at Melbourne, I gave the GOTO Berlin one; at Brisbane, the original one with updated code and design diagrams. &nbsp;Since the Brisbane one got a higher score, I went with that with some minor tweaks for Sydney. &nbsp;The upshot is, people like hand-drawn pictures of monsters, and are less keen on understanding the internals of MongoDB. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s useful to know.</div><div><br /></div><div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />But the talks aren&rsquo;t the only things that make a conference. &nbsp;And YOW got the other stuff right too:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tw7VJOelqZI/UrhYDYgURFI/AAAAAAAAMCw/7sGUtQo8QnQ/s1600/1Catamaran.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tw7VJOelqZI/UrhYDYgURFI/AAAAAAAAMCw/7sGUtQo8QnQ/s320/1Catamaran.jpg" width="265" /></a><li>I loved the drinks receptions in the evenings, that&rsquo;s a great place for people to come and ask you questions about your talk, stuff they might not want to share in front of everyone. &nbsp;Note to attendees - if you do see a speaker at a drinks/network/mingle event, feel free to chat to them. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re there for you guys, and we&rsquo;re only people ourselves and like the company. &nbsp;At many events, the speakers know very few people.</li><li>Sydney had an outdoor eating area, which was awesome - if you&rsquo;re going to spend weeks in a conference hall, it&rsquo;s nice to get outside for food.</li><li>There was a, um, misunderstanding about appropriate dress code for one of the vendors. &nbsp;The conference organisers were on this immediately, and, to their credit, the vendor acted swiftly with no fuss. &nbsp;A great example of how to handle this sort of thing at tech conferences.</li><li>Having all the travel and accommodation, particularly for this complicated trip, arranged by very capable and approachable people made the speakers&rsquo; lives really easy, and I think that helped us to be more prepared and relaxed for our talks.</li><li>A speaker&rsquo;s excursion (on a boat!) at the weekend was an amazing way to bond with the other guys.</li></ul><div>I loved YOW, I hope I can go again.</div></div></div></div></p>
