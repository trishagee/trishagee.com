           <p>You know how I keep banging on about attracting different types of people into programming? &nbsp;You know how we say we need to get them young?<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1yinSe4_orw/UZzXQoQZr8I/AAAAAAAALkY/HgxArcLwj1Q/s1600/mathematician.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right;

margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--jyL0hdI850/UZzXQIWZAKI/AAAAAAAALkU/OaFVMinjJck/s1600/engineer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left;

margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PiUd3wctHFo/UZzXRf_c6lI/AAAAAAAALkk/csUH7zuafck/s1600/scientist.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PiUd3wctHFo/UZzXRf_c6lI/AAAAAAAALkk/csUH7zuafck/s320/scientist.jpg" width="267" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Typical Scientist?</td></tr></tbody></table><i>We</i> are the people the schools are looking for. &nbsp;We have the experience - years of it. &nbsp;We have the context for that awkward question &ldquo;but when am I ever going to use this stuff?&rdquo;. &nbsp;We can show them why it&rsquo;s fun.<br /><br />But what&rsquo;s in it for us? &nbsp;Well, it looks great on your CV, of course, and you&rsquo;ll get to network and meet with other professionals, including those in different but overlapping fields. &nbsp;Kids also have really interesting approaches to problems. &nbsp;It has been known for groups of children to provide novel answers to problems that have stumped professionals. &nbsp;And doing something like this is really great for your confidence - if you can speak about what you do in front of a group of children, all staring at you, then speaking in meetings or conferences becomes infinitely easier. &nbsp;I honestly believe that all the times I spent in a classroom helping out one or other of my parents is the reason I&rsquo;m more relaxed speaking at conferences than I ever thought I would be.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-klM3xjs-A6w/UZzXR8VKcwI/AAAAAAAALko/cIuVUmMTUkk/s1600/geek.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="199" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-klM3xjs-A6w/UZzXR8VKcwI/AAAAAAAALko/cIuVUmMTUkk/s320/geek.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Typical Technologist?</td></tr></tbody></table>Sadly, I let my Ambassador status lapse when I got a &ldquo;real&rdquo; job in London, it became so much more difficult to create the time to go into a school, since clearly it needs to be during work hours. &nbsp;But nearly ten years later, after talk of <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/4KIDS/Home">Devoxx4Kids</a> and a bunch of other initiatives to get kids coding, I decided I needed at least to get my <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/overview">CRB (now DBS) checks</a> done so I could work with children if the opportunity came up. &nbsp;If you sign up as an&nbsp;ambassador, STEMNET will sort this out for you for free, which is one of the main reasons I chose to sign up with them again.<br /><br />Another great thing is the induction - they&rsquo;re not going to let you loose with the kids without&nbsp;providing&nbsp;a bit of help and guidance. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s only a couple of hours out of your day, and, if nothing else, gives you an opportunity to meet interesting people in other STEM jobs. &nbsp;On my induction there were surprisingly few IT people (maybe 3-4). &nbsp;There were various apprentices, structural engineers, dentists, ex-teachers, PhD students and&hellip; oh I&rsquo;ve totally forgotten what everyone did, but it was interesting and sciencey. &nbsp;And about half of the inductees were women, which enormously surprised me. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if programming is lagging well behind the other STEM jobs in terms of women doing the role, but I don&rsquo;t think you can draw a conclusion based on a group of people who either chose to be mentors or were pushed gently (or not so gently) in that direction.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RaFaSj1Hmp8/UZzTIAf5HOI/AAAAAAAALkE/U2662Y01VFE/s1600/2013-05-21+13.56.09.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RaFaSj1Hmp8/UZzTIAf5HOI/AAAAAAAALkE/U2662Y01VFE/s640/2013-05-21+13.56.09.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />The induction covers stuff that I&rsquo;ve already talked about here - like why you should do this and what teachers, students and ambassadors get out of it - and some basic dos and don&rsquo;ts for working with kids. &nbsp;Nothing too scary, and even though I&rsquo;ve done this before I found it useful and made me more keen to be involved. &nbsp;The minimal commitment is one event a year, and this can even be something you&rsquo;ve arranged yourself (like going into your own kids&rsquo; school). &nbsp;And although I&rsquo;ve signed up for the London area, it&rsquo;s not necessarily geographically constrained - one of the ideas I liked the most is taking kids for a Skype tour around your office, showing where you work, how you work, etc. &nbsp;I think that will help blow away some of the preconceptions around programmers anti-socially sitting in their own rooms hacking out lines of code, for example.<br /><br />You&rsquo;ll notice the rather lovely drawings littering this post. &nbsp;The first exercise we did in the induction was to draw a stereotypical scientist, technologist, engineer, and&nbsp;mathematician. &nbsp;The point of being an ambassador is to help combat these stereotypes, giving kids real role models to look to, people who can help them see what&rsquo;s out there for them. <br /><br />These kids don&rsquo;t necessarily want to be Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.<br /><br />Some of them want to be just like you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
