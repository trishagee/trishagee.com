&nbsp;It was refreshing to meet new people, especially because they&rsquo;re mostly in different technology and business spaces. &nbsp;I was really inspired to see the number of entrepreneurs, and people working for startups. &nbsp;And I loved the range of ages, the diversity of people&rsquo;s backgrounds (ethnically, educationally, geographically&hellip;), and the fact that everyone bothered to come out on a <i>very</i>&nbsp;rainy Sunday to learn stuff and meet people.<br /><br />It did feel different to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conferences. &nbsp;<i>However</i>. &nbsp;I personally do not believe this was because it was an all-women event.<br /><br />The <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/london-java-community-open-conference.html">LJC Open Conference</a> last year had a very different feel to JAX London and JavaOne - it was more intimate, easier to wing-it in presentations, friendlier. &nbsp;You could chat to pretty much anyone over the coffee. You could smile at random people. &nbsp;These are all the same things I felt about GGM today.<br /><br />I can&rsquo;t help but think this atmosphere of supportive learning and collaboration is at least partly a function of things like:<br /><br /><ul><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5knk3-7_MGg/T52gXahpfRI/AAAAAAAAKKI/MNWVYBmKSkk/s1600/DSC_0027.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5knk3-7_MGg/T52gXahpfRI/AAAAAAAAKKI/MNWVYBmKSkk/s320/DSC_0027.jpg" width="214" /></a><li>Size - smaller conferences are less intimidating, and you get to meet with people more than once, giving you the impression you&rsquo;re with friends rather than spectators.</li><li>Venue - being seated (or even standing) around a table or in a coffee-break area is more intimate. &nbsp;It means the speaker can make better eye contact, feels more engaged with the audience, and there&rsquo;s less of a barrier for active participation. &nbsp;If the presenter is less than 3 metres from you, it&rsquo;s much easier to ask a question. &nbsp;This leads to a chattier, more tailored session - more of a dialogue than a speech. &nbsp;As a speaker I really prefer these sessions, and I think as an attendee I get more out of this too.</li><li>Common Goal - when you give up a day in your weekend to do &ldquo;work&rdquo; stuff, you have to have a clear idea of why you&rsquo;re doing it and what you&rsquo;re getting out of it. &nbsp;I would say (although I could be wrong) that our common goal was to network, with a side-effect of learning &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. &nbsp;Events at the weekend are really only something you do for yourself, since you&rsquo;re not being paid for it. &nbsp;That gives you common ground.</li></ul><div>I wanted to get a feel for if these awesome women were only going to events like these, and weren&rsquo;t going to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conferences. &nbsp;I think it was a mix. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think (and I could be wrong) that people were coming to this <i>because</i> there were no guys. &nbsp;I think they were coming because <i>they</i> were invited. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Someone mentioned that a conference organiser once told them they have to ask a man to speak at their conference at most two times. &nbsp;They have to ask a woman up to seven times, to overcome their concerns and reassure them that they really do want them. &nbsp;I wonder if women also need to be asked several times simply to attend conferences? &nbsp;This would make a lot of sense - about 15-20% of the technical workforce are women, but around 5% of conference attendees are women. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possibly that by the time women have been invited to, or told about, a conference enough times to make them want to go, it&rsquo;s totally sold out. &nbsp;Do we need to very explicitly&nbsp;invite women to our events? &nbsp;Show them we really want them? &nbsp;Multiple times? &nbsp;And this is just for attendees, not even speakers.</div><div><br /></div><div>I&rsquo;ll come back to some of this.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pkwtZMrZs04/T52gPEVqtuI/AAAAAAAAKJY/Xp3q_1DtSNE/s1600/DSC_0003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="147" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pkwtZMrZs04/T52gPEVqtuI/AAAAAAAAKJY/Xp3q_1DtSNE/s400/DSC_0003.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The schedule</td></tr></tbody></table><div>I presented on four occasions - yes, I was so greedy for fame that I actually had almost no time to talk to people or to see anyone else&rsquo;s sessions.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Why Open Source Your Secrets</b></div><div>A different spin on the Disruptor, when I answer the number one (well, number two actually) question: why did we open source it?</div><div><br /></div><div>The slides are pretty simple and I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s a lot of value in putting them online without the talking, but if anyone&rsquo;s interested I can either shrink it to a lightning talk at one of the LJC events, or attempt to expand it into a fully-fledged presentation</div><div><br /></div><div><b>GDC: Meet a Mentor</b></div><div>What it is, what&rsquo;s involved, what&rsquo;s in it for you. &nbsp;This is all material that needs to live somewhere on the interwebs so I promise to link to it as soon as it&rsquo;s available. &nbsp;If anyone is interested in a really lightweight process for mentoring university undergraduates, drop me a line and I&rsquo;ll try and tell you all about it.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Technology in Electronic Trading (co-presented with Annalisa Sarasini)</b></div><div>This is the session I was most nervous about, since with Annalisa in Nepal and me in Seville, we didn&rsquo;t actually get a chance to talk about what we were doing, let alone rehearse it. &nbsp;However I think it went really well - at the end of it, the folks who saw it said they had a better understanding of the use of technology in the banking/finance world, and I think it&rsquo;s a great way to show how computer science can truly be applied. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d love to run this as a full talk somewhere.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Panel: Women-only events - are we creating a Girl Ghetto?</b></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rJmojN4eWHo/T52gT9XFdyI/AAAAAAAAKJw/kKmQTfyXWAo/s1600/DSC_0016.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rJmojN4eWHo/T52gT9XFdyI/AAAAAAAAKJw/kKmQTfyXWAo/s320/DSC_0016.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center;">Oh my goodness, all these women!</td></tr></tbody></table><div>In which I get to say that I think it&rsquo;s grossly unfair we do not allow men to this event. &nbsp;In which I state that this behaviour is sexist and (in my mind) unhelpful. &nbsp;But in which I also am told that women are still either a) experiencing alienation/sexist behaviour at conferences (thankfully it seemed like a limited amount) or b) feel like there are issues around boys club, macho posturing males, and thought if they presented at a conference they might get questions designed specifically to make them feel stupid.</div><div><br /></div><div>I think this is a very important point - even if none of this is happening, even if these women have never experienced this themselves, they think it <i>might</i> be happening. &nbsp;Also, please note, these issues do not affect just women. &nbsp;These perceived problems are stopping less confident men from attending or speaking at these events.</div><div><br /></div><div>What can be done about these things? &nbsp;My answer is, it&rsquo;s up to <i>us</i>. &nbsp;The women, the less confident, the non-posturing non-alpha males, to make the changes we want to see. &nbsp;And I can&rsquo;t claim all the glory for that answer. &nbsp;When, during my very short stay at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>, I complained to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> that GOTO 2011 was full of white, male speakers, he said to me, why don&rsquo;t <i>you </i>speak then? &nbsp;Of course I said &ldquo;who, me??&rdquo;. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t think I had anything to talk about. &nbsp;After attending a few conferences I realised that doesn&rsquo;t stop people. &nbsp;And I realised people have to start somewhere. &nbsp;And you have to start by doing some poor presentations to practice - you can&rsquo;t instantly be awesome. &nbsp;It takes time, and practice, and Barrack Obama didn&rsquo;t come out of the womb knowing how to make an impact during a speech. &nbsp;And guess what? &nbsp;This year I&rsquo;m speaking at GOTO Copenhagen and Amsterdam.</div><div><br /></div><div>So my answer is, you want something? &nbsp;Ask for it. &nbsp;You want more women presenters? &nbsp;Volunteer. &nbsp;That panel is full of men? &nbsp;Find out who organised it and what you need to do to be on it next year. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s down to <i>us</i>. &nbsp;Not to the conference organisers. &nbsp;Not to some great beneficent <i>them</i>. The responsibility is ours. &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s better than that - the control is ours.<br /><br />Only you know what it is you want. &nbsp;Only you can speak for you. &nbsp;Not for all women; not for all white/black/purple people; not for all straight/gay/ambivalent folks; not for all geeks. &nbsp;The question isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;What do women want?&rdquo; but &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> want?&ldquo;.</div><div><br /></div><div>I think I saw some lightbulbs go off in the audience. &nbsp;I hope so. &nbsp;These women were all awesome, they have a lot to share with the world. &nbsp;We all do, even the tiniest experience, the smallest thing we&rsquo;ve learnt is something someone else might not know yet. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s get out there and share it.</div></p>
