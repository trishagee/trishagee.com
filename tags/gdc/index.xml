      <description>&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&#34;http://careers.grad-dc.co.uk/2012/05/18/107/&#34;&gt;yet another interview&lt;/a&gt; with me is available, but this one is in written form. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s for the Graduate Developer Community, the aim is to show undergraduates and graduates what real techies jobs are like, and how people doing them they got there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s long, but if you know anyone just starting out their career who wants to get a feel for where they might want to go, please point them at it. &amp;nbsp;The site has a number of interviews with people in different roles so it&amp;rsquo;s quite a good way to showcase the diversity of what&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/p&gt;
