    <p>YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at <a href="http://vimeo.com/72982916">GeeCON</a> and <a href="http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about">DevoxxUK</a>,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.</p>

    </header>

    Wow. My 4th QCon London.&nbsp; That’s not bad.&nbsp; And every time, it’s a different experience (if you must, see my blogs for&nbsp;2013,&nbsp;2012, and even 2007 (part 1 &amp; part 2 - how cute was I? &ldquo;agile seems like a jolly good idea; automated testing appears to be important&rdquo;)).I can’t even tell you what I did on the first day, I was mostly panicking about my presentation - I was inspired after my trip to New York last month to change my talk at the last (responsible?) minute and do a live coding session, something much more technical than my recent talks.&nbsp; I’ll leave the details for a separate blog post though, when the video comes out.The thing that stands out for me from Wednesday though was Damian Conway programming Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life in Klingon.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Just find the video and watch it, the man is a genius.The Thursday keynote was inspiring too from a totally different point of view - Tim Lister of Peopleware fame shared stories from his career, and I came away from that really happy I work as a technologist, but with an increased desire to learn off other amazing people.On Thursday I hosted the&nbsp;&ldquo;Not Only Java&ldquo;&nbsp;track - I’m on the programme committee for QCon, and this year we wanted to cover&nbsp;leading edge technologies (as always) but we didn’t want to slice things into strict technology silos [interruption: argh!

    Dick Wall -&nbsp;The Tao, of the Joy, of CodingI’m on a plane (there’s a surprise) on my way back from The Joy of Coding.&nbsp; It’s the title that attracted me to this conference, and it was a great little one day event with awesome people like Dan North, Erik Meijer and Dick Wall presenting.&nbsp; What I liked about the themes is they were broadly technology agnostic, pulling back to a level which made me remember why I’m a developer.

    So, following on from my observations of being an outsider at FOSDEM because I&rsquo;m not an open source developer, I do have another story to tell where my female-ness is actually relevant.I&rsquo;m going to give specifics, but it&rsquo;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&rsquo;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.At JFokus (a conference I really enjoyed, where I got a chance to spend time with some awesome people) I was on a panel (well, game-show really) about static vs dynamic languages.

    So, FOSDEM.I've heard great things about this conference, so I was pretty exited to goThe Java dev roomNow I know people talk about impostor syndrome whenever they mention the woeful lack of diversity at tech conferences.&nbsp; Interestingly, I felt like an impostor at FOSDEM - not because I'm a woman (there were quite a few techy women around at FOSDEM, more than I expected) but because I'm not an open source person.I mean, I am, technically - MongoDB and the Java driver are both open source, and I have real live code on github.&nbsp; But I didn't get there via the open source community, I was hired to do a specific job that happens to be open source (for which I am extremely grateful).&nbsp; So although I knew the MongoDB folks I was there with and a lot of people who were running or speaking in the Java room, I didn't feel really at home in this conference.&nbsp; I think I feel more comfortable with the ones aimed at enterprise Java developers (by which I mean Java people who work producing software for companies) because this is more similar to my background - I understand the attendees and I think I know what they want.It's also possible since I've been to a lot more of the enterprise-aimed conferences that I used to feel just as awkward there, and I've become much more comfortable now I've been to many.Which leads me to another observation: when I first went to JavaOne, in 2011, I felt extremely conspicuous as a woman.&nbsp; I mean, I didn't do much to help, my skirts and shorts are occasionally… not really enterprise-developer-length.&nbsp; But I felt like everyone noticed me and I felt the pressure to assert early on in every new conversation that I was, in fact, a developer and not a booth babe or a recruiter.&nbsp; But these days, I feel much more comfortable.&nbsp; And do you know what's really helped with that?&nbsp; Being a speaker; having my face on the website.&nbsp; I don't have to prove I'm a developer, I was asked to speak at that conference - if the conference organisers think I belong there, then I belong there.So… what.Well, we can do things to combat this I-don't-belong-here feeling -&nbsp;I'm pretty sure we've all been there, regardless of gender, race, background etc.

    December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&rsquo;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. &nbsp;A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.I cannot take Christmas seriously in this weatherYOW!&nbsp;is a unique conference, in that it&rsquo;s the same agenda in three different cities: Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.

    In previous years, JAX London would have been an easy, local conference to go to. This time it took me most of Sunday to get there, and not because of the Super Storm. Still, that gave me the day to finish off the tutorial I was running there on Monday morning. Not that I would be so unprofessional as to leave preparing things until the last minute, oh no&hellip;. But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java Community.

    So, I thought a few months ago that my blog would become more of a travel blog than a tech blog because of the amount of conferences I was going to. &nbsp;Turned out that I was so busy writing / updating / practicing talks and workshops and, er, travelling, that I never got around to doing retrospectives on the events I&rsquo;d been to.So, JavaOne, again, my third year there. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll always have a fondness for it - because of Martin Thompson, it was the first conference I presented at.

    InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. &nbsp;Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. &nbsp;We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&rsquo;s going through the interviewer&rsquo;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.Hire Education - Making Interviews RockIt&rsquo;s kind of funny because we talk a lot about hiring at ThoughtWorks (where we both worked, and which has one of the toughest interview processes in the industry) and LMAX, which learnt a lot off ThoughtWorks and shaped its own process for a smaller company that has different goals.

    I was expecting this&hellip;So, I was in China last week. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not really what I expected, but then my knowledge of China comes almost entirely from visiting various Chinatowns and watching martial arts movies, so I guess I wasn&rsquo;t all that well prepared for a modern Asian city like Shanghai.&hellip;and found this insteadThe city is, in my opinion, clean, modern, and attractive. &nbsp;I was surprised by American-looking early skyscrapers, and really surprised that the city overall felt more European than American - with Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, Carrefour, H &amp; M, Zara, Costa Coffee, as well as the inevitable McDonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut.Some of the architecture reminded me more of New York than Europe or AsiaI felt like they had the option to take the best of all worlds - the modern, high tech and sometimes downright weird influence of Japan; a care for heritage from Europe; the consumer choice of the US; and food from all over China and the world.OK, I didn&rsquo;t eat here, but I did love the food in ShanghaiThe food was awesome and, by my London-standards, very reasonably priced.

    Last week I was in Krakow, Poland for GeeCON. &nbsp;Which was excellent! &nbsp;I find it really interesting that conferences all have their own personalities, that they are not all the same. GeeCON had its own distinct personality. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re a Java/JVM person based in Poland, I would highly recommend it - more than 90% of the attendees were Polish (probably the remainder were largely speakers) so this conference is very much for you.

    So, despite promising myself that I would only do one event a month for the rest of this year, looks like I&rsquo;m going to be a bit busier than that.In case you&rsquo;re wondering what I&rsquo;m up to (or, even better, hoping to see me talk or meet me), here are my confirmed engagements:15-17 May - GeeCon, Poland18-20 June - GOTO Amsterdam - whole day tutorial on the new (unfinished) MongoDB Java driver.24th June - STAC Summit, London - something MongoDB-shaped (i.e.

    Last week was the first Devoxx UK, bringing the brand from Belgium and, more recently, France. And I think it was a HUGE success. Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome. Although in all honesty, even being slightly involved in the organisation of a conference is a lot of work, and you can&rsquo;t wait to see the back of it (and I didn&rsquo;t do half as much as some people).

    I like QCon London, I really do. &nbsp;Not only is it on home turf, but, as I&rsquo;ve said before, it doesn&rsquo;t just focus on technology, or a set of technologies.Full disclosure: I&rsquo;ve been involved in planning QCon this year. &nbsp;So this time I know all the thinking, hard work, planning and last-minute changes that go into a conference like this. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s a joy to be able to sit in the audience and see the conference that you&rsquo;ve helped build.There are things I took out of today that I want to get down on &ldquo;paper&rdquo; now, because I think the next few days will have different themes.Let&rsquo;s Not Forget About Computer ScienceI&rsquo;m so pleased to see this in a conference!

    As well as talking about, you know, actual work-type-stuff, I was encouraged to give my &ldquo;Technical Approach to Women&rdquo; presentation at Devoxx. &nbsp;This went so well at JavaOne that I thought it would be difficult to top. &nbsp;Also, I wasn&rsquo;t convinced it would work at Devoxx, because the theatres are not well suited to audience participation - the seats are warm and comfy, the room is dark, the speaker is on stage in front of a massive screen&hellip;.I was incredibly impressed with the audience.

    Saturday I had the pleasure of being part of the 5th London Java Community Open Conference. &nbsp;This is a great event to end the conference season on - it made me feel good about being part of the LJC, and &nbsp;got me excited about the prospects for 2013.The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&rsquo;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&rsquo;t expect to.Given how much I&rsquo;ve been presenting lately, and with the conferences piling on top of each other back-to-back leaving little time for preparation, I had decided not to speak at the open conference, but to sit and learn for a change - it&rsquo;s a great opportunity for new speakers to present for a start.

    Devoxx topped off a crazy two months of conferences.

    Seemed like a quiet conference this year. &nbsp;Not really sure why, maybe it was the layout of the massive (and extremely dark) main room; maybe it was the awkward L-shape of the communal space; or maybe this year people were more interested in listening to the (really very good) sessions rather than participating or meeting other people. &nbsp;Whatever the reason, it felt quiet and almost low-key.Performance seemed pretty high on the agenda, as you&rsquo;d expect from a London conference, with a number of things on offer:A great keynote from Kirk Pepperdine and Martijn Verburg, covering a massive range of things to care about when thinking about performance on the first nightA high-level talk about Java Performance from yours truly (which I may run again for the LJC if there&rsquo;s interest, but it&rsquo;s more likely to be a one-off)A deep dive into writing lock-free coding by Mike BarkerAnd a talk from Kirk exploring your GC logs.It was great to see a number of LJC regulars presenting, especially as my own schedule has been so crazy I haven&rsquo;t seen many of them for a long time.

    So, JavaOne.Taylor Street CafeI'm going to be controversial. &nbsp;I think this was my favourite conference of this year. &nbsp;I know that's not trendy, and that Oracle-bashing is still a popular pastime. &nbsp;And I know I've also made a big deal about how much fun it is to meet people who program in different languages. &nbsp;But there is something very special about being surrounded by thousands of people from all around the world who use the same technology as you, some facing the same problems, some solving very different issues.Maybe it's because since I first spoke at JavaOne last year I've met a lot of people in this ecosystem - Oracle Java people, other conference organisers, Java User Group leaders, speakers and attendees from all sorts of places - and seeing many of them in one place is fun and makes you feel like you're "home".

    Yesterday dawned, with a sense of foreboding (actually it dawned with me coughing my lungs out, but we&rsquo;ve heard enough about the sub-optimal state of my respiratory system this week). &nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, I was giving the talk I was dreading when I got asked to do it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the talk I actually put more work into than any of the other sessions I was presenting at this JavaOne.&nbsp; It was the Women In IT talk.It&rsquo;s timely, given that conference season has one again led to cries of sexism and discrimination.

    Well this is exciting! &nbsp;JavaOne 2011 is the first conference I spoke at, so this the first time I&rsquo;ve covered the same conference two years running. &nbsp;I think.It&rsquo;s very nice to be back at JavaOne. &nbsp;Last year&nbsp;it was my first opportunity to meet so many people - the guys at Oracle who work really hard to make sure Java has its own identity; the JUG Leaders and Duchess folk; the JCP EC committee members; and loads of people who live and work in the area who I wouldn&rsquo;t normally get a chance to speak to in person.This year I&rsquo;m here with several other&nbsp;London Java Community&nbsp;people, and it&rsquo;s great to be a member of the Alumni, to have the privilege of showing other guys around and introducing people to each other.

    Last week (was it only last week?)

    I&rsquo;ve been challenged to do a session at a very large conference around women in programming. &nbsp;Which leads to two reactions from me 1) wow, what an honour! and 2) sigh.The problem with these sessions is that you&rsquo;re preaching to the choir.&nbsp; Those who turn up are a) women or b) men who are sympathetic and supportive to the cause.&nbsp; People who are actively discriminating against women or, more commonly, those who don&rsquo;t know their actions are hurting diversity in our industry, are the least likely to receive the message.This tends to lead to the same types of sessions - yes, our industry under-represents certain segments of society (i.e.

    I&rsquo;m late with my write-up of QCon, and what&rsquo;s worse, it will be partial - &ldquo;sadly&rdquo; I was in Lanzarote on a training week with the running club from the Thursday (8th) so I missed most of it.&nbsp; A sacrifice I had to make for 7 days in the sunshine….Firstly, me me meI presented the talk I previewed at Skillsmatter the previous week, something I was calling the User&rsquo;s Guide to the Disruptor, but actually turned out to be how-can-Trish-fill-95-slides-with-pictures-and-finish-in-under-40-minutes.The audience was different to the Skillsmatter event, not surprisingly.&nbsp; What was surprising is that I expected people at the conference to be less aware of the Disruptor, and those who came to the Disruptor-only LJC event to have had more exposure to it.&nbsp; It was a (pleasant) surprise to see how many of the standing-room-only audience had not only heard of the Disruptor but had read stuff about it (I always love it when people have read my blog), played with it and were even using it in anger.Because of that, I think if anything the talk did not go into enough detail, or enough new stuff, to please everyone.&nbsp; Tough crowd!&nbsp; But it was gratifying to hear the audience correct me in some of my answers, and answer other people&rsquo;s questions - it&rsquo;s always nice to know people are listening.Of course, I will post a link to the presentation when it&rsquo;s available.

    In theory, I am busy writing material for my upcoming speaking events, rather than writing terribly illuminating posts on my blog (see what I did there?). &nbsp;In actuality I am being lazy and have pretty much taken January off for a recharge.In the spirit of doing something which ticks both the event-speaking and blogging boxes, this is a quick update on the conferences I&rsquo;m confirmed for so far. &nbsp;Put the following dates in your diary - these are my first international solo speaking events:7th March - QCon London - Concurrent Programming Using The Disruptor&nbsp;(sadly I can&rsquo;t stay for the whole conference as it clashes with the only holiday I had booked for 2012).23rd May - GOTO Copenhagen - Concurrent Programming Using The Disruptor&nbsp;&amp; War Stories.25-26th May - GOTO Amsterdam - Concurrent Programming Using The Disruptor.The presentation will be more of a user&rsquo;s guide to the Disruptor than anything we&rsquo;ve done before.

    At JAX London Mike and I presented &ldquo;Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&rdquo;. This is the session we initially previewed to the London Java Community a few weeks earlier. The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage, which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.

    Saturday was, hopefully, my last conference of the year. &nbsp;My lucky readers should start to see some posts which are not simply me gushing about another opportunity to hang out with awesome people and learn about interesting &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.Who wants to propose a session?In many ways the London Java Community Open Conference was my favourite one so far, and not just because it&rsquo;s near home and I helped to organise it. &nbsp;One of the awesome things about both Java One and Devoxx was the opportunity to travel, to see new places and to meet people you might not meet in London.

    I&rsquo;m back from Devoxx, having had lots of food for thought. &nbsp;In particular, my panel on Why We Shouldn&rsquo;t Target Women generated a lot of discussion and I&rsquo;m still trying to process it all.Martijn Verburg; Regina ten Bruggencate; Trisha Gee; Antonio Goncalves; Claude Falguière; Kim Ross&nbsp;The panel went really well, we got decent interaction from the audience, and of course my fellow panel members were awesome. &nbsp;I managed to restrain myself from using the opportunity as my own personal soap box and allowed other people to speak occasionally.

    Stephan wearing the Brazilian flag at the opening keynoteEuropean conferences are different (and cool) because you get to hear even more languages spoken than you usually do in London (apparently the most diverse city in the world for spoken languages). &nbsp;I think the idea of a Paris Devoxx with 75% of the talks in French is brilliant - I&rsquo;m always banging on about diversity, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect developers to learn&nbsp;in English only.Really great to meet up with some of the people I met at Java One and am starting to feel more a part of the global community.Seems to me there are slightly more women here than at the other conferences I&rsquo;ve been to, and not just because Regina and I pulled together four women for a panel on women technologists.

    A couple of weeks ago, I was at JAX London along with a number of the London Java Community regulars (Martijn/Ben/John/Sandro/Simon/Zoe I&rsquo;m looking at you&hellip;.)My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners talk that Mike and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me.

    I discovered, through the power of the search words that lead to my blog, that there was an incident at JavaOne that once again opens the can of worms that is Sexism In IT.This Makes Me Sad. &nbsp;I had a really positive experience at JavaOne. &nbsp;In fact, I would say it was the one conference I&rsquo;ve been to in the last 12 months where I felt like my gender wasn&rsquo;t a problem - I even got away with wearing hotpants (tweed is business-casual, right??) without being mistaken for anything other than a developer.I know incidents like this cause a lot of tension, and I want to explore why.

    Having been back in London for a few days I&rsquo;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. &nbsp;Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&rsquo;m just not jaded yet. &nbsp;But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):First and foremost, the people. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t remember meeting a single grumpy person.

    So I&rsquo;ve been at JavaOne for the better part of three days, it&rsquo;s time to record some of my observations so far:The wireless access is rubbish.&lt;Gross generalisation&gt; technical people are not natural public speakers. &nbsp;Makes me feel better about the presentations I&rsquo;m going to be giving (see A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency).The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve had a really excellent time, I&rsquo;ve met: people from other Java User Groups; the Duchess girls; other Duke Award winners; the Azul guys; guys (well, girls) from O&rsquo;Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.Everyone thinks that Large is an acceptable default t-shirt size (it&rsquo;s not).

    On Wednesday I tagged along to the STAC London Summit to provide backup for Mike, who was on the &ldquo;The Future of Messaging Middleware&rdquo; panel.The panel consisted of two messaging providers, one hardware (Solace Systems) and one software (29West/Informatica), and two &ldquo;users&rdquo;, Citihub and LMAX. &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously both providers were arguing that theirs was the best solution. But what I found interesting is that I came away with the impression that everyone was really on the same side - everyone wants to use or to provide the best system, but there are different approaches.

    I attended TradeTech last week, an annual event about Equities and Derivatives trading. I assumed from the title that there would be a reasonable focus on technology, but I found it was more “Trade” and less “Tech”.The fascinating thing to me was how different this is from the sorts of technology conferences I&rsquo;ve been to. For example, I popped into JAX this week (albeit in the evening for drinks). At technology conferences (&lt;gross-generalisation&gt;) people tend to subscribe to a variety of dress codes and fashion clans, usually from jeans through the range of business casual, including your fair share of goths and alternatives.
