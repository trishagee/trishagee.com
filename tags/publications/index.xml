      <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/20120304/?pg=56&amp;amp;pm=1&amp;amp;u1=friend&#34;&gt;month&amp;rsquo;s Java Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;features an article by yours truly, which is yet another intro to the Disruptor. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s basically a summary of the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve written in this blog, updated for version 2.7 - so the names of the classes should be up to date and the responsibilities follow the simplified pattern we use now. &amp;nbsp;If you were looking for an more recent version of my introduction blog posts, this article gives a reasonable overview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is intended as part one of a series, as it&amp;rsquo;s a basic and high-level view&amp;nbsp;with no code examples. &amp;nbsp;In fact, it probably could be used to document the C# version as well as the Java version, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken a look at that for a while. &amp;nbsp;Next, I would like to give some more code examples of how you use it - as always, any suggestions welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
