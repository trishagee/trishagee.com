      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week (was it only last week?) I was at &lt;a href=&#34;https://thestrangeloop.com/&#34;&gt;Strange Loop&lt;/a&gt;, presenting a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/strangeloop-disruptor-workshop-materials.html&#34;&gt;workshop on the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jt5DFeC5wNo/UGee7BSeo3I/AAAAAAAALJY/le-weiSydUs/s1600/hotel.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jt5DFeC5wNo/UGee7BSeo3I/AAAAAAAALJY/le-weiSydUs/s320/hotel.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have any expectations from the conference, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been before and, if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of it before. &amp;nbsp;So everything was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a very geeky conference. &amp;nbsp;I mean that as a compliment, of course. &amp;nbsp;Lots of very smart people talking about stuff that&amp;rsquo;s waaaay more advanced than you frequently get in the conferences employers would be happy to pay for. &amp;nbsp;The themes I mostly saw were functional programming and the (insert horribly abused term) Big Data space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So nothing about Spring and Hibernate or any of their ilk, of course. &amp;nbsp;Almost nothing about Java actually, as if a language that is actually used by millions of developers is somehow too&amp;nbsp;pass√©. &amp;nbsp;But this was extremely liberating - if there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that&amp;rsquo;s going to be applicable to my day job, I can go and see talks on things I&amp;rsquo;m actually interested in. &amp;nbsp;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say the day job is not interesting, of course, but removing the constraint meant the only criteria for selecting talks was &amp;ldquo;Will I learn something I didn&amp;rsquo;t know before?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite talk was Jeff Hawkins&amp;rsquo; keynote, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/computing-like-the-brain&#34;&gt;Computing Like the Brain&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It was as if he was trying to download several decades of research on neuroscience into our brains in less than 30 minutes. &amp;nbsp;It was incredible! &amp;nbsp;Fascinating, and the stuff of science fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QaupZv7WIN0/UGeh0uLL_qI/AAAAAAAALJw/4GKastaWFvM/s1600/foyer.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QaupZv7WIN0/UGeh0uLL_qI/AAAAAAAALJw/4GKastaWFvM/s320/foyer.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The quality of speakers was really good, big names that many would recognise, all talking about their passions. &amp;nbsp;And it was another friendly conference, where lots of people appeared to be there on their own, and were happy to get chatting to randoms like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of people too. &amp;nbsp;I had expected it to be quite a small, intimate conference. &amp;nbsp;But while it&amp;rsquo;s not JavaOne, there were a lot more people than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to St Louis before either. &amp;nbsp;However, since I voluntarily spent all my time between the hotel and the venue, I think I can safely say I still haven&amp;rsquo;t really been there. &amp;nbsp;But &lt;a href=&#34;http://peabodyoperahouse.com/&#34;&gt;the venue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/stlus-st-louis-union-station-marriott/&#34;&gt;the hotel&lt;/a&gt; were really beautiful places, as well as being dead conveniently placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I enjoyed Strange Loop. &amp;nbsp;It was a little strange, and I was out of my comfort zone, but I had an interesting time and met yet more great people. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;d love to go again next year, if I get the chance (hint hint).&lt;/p&gt;
