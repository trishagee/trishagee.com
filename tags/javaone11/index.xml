      <description>&lt;p&gt;It must be time for me to move on from talking about Java One, it has dominated my blog of late. &amp;nbsp;But also I want to talk about JAX London from this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before I move on, it&amp;rsquo;s probably worth rounding off with the last two resources from the conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and I are interviewed about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor &lt;/a&gt;winning the Duke Award (we come in halfway through):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object id=&#34;flashObj&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#FFFFFF&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;videoId=1203095587001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmedianetwork.oracle.com%2Fvideo%2Fplayer%2F1203095587001&amp;playerID=1217746023001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFcSbzI~,OkyYKKfkn3x1llKvCBQgVazGCPhNSKRX&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;base&#34; value=&#34;http://admin.brightcove.com&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;seamlesstabbing&#34; value=&#34;false&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;swLiveConnect&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowScriptAccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1&#34; bgcolor=&#34;#FFFFFF&#34; flashVars=&#34;videoId=1203095587001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmedianetwork.oracle.com%2Fvideo%2Fplayer%2F1203095587001&amp;playerID=1217746023001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFcSbzI~,OkyYKKfkn3x1llKvCBQgVazGCPhNSKRX&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true&#34; base=&#34;http://admin.brightcove.com&#34; name=&#34;flashObj&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; seamlesstabbing=&#34;false&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowScriptAccess=&#34;always&#34; swLiveConnect=&#34;true&#34; pluginspage=&#34;http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I&amp;rsquo;m interviewed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;Duchess&lt;/a&gt; about life, the universe and everything (well, the London Java Community, the JCP, the LMAX Disruptor and Duke Award, and women programmers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;object classid=&#34;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; id=&#34;flashObj&#34; width=&#34;640&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#FFFFFF&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;videoId=1231299099001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmedianetwork.oracle.com%2Fvideo%2Fplayer%2F1231299099001&amp;playerID=1217746023001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFcSbzI~,OkyYKKfkn3x1llKvCBQgVazGCPhNSKRX&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;base&#34; value=&#34;http://admin.brightcove.com&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;seamlesstabbing&#34; value=&#34;false&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;swLiveConnect&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowScriptAccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1&#34; bgcolor=&#34;#FFFFFF&#34; flashVars=&#34;videoId=1231299099001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmedianetwork.oracle.com%2Fvideo%2Fplayer%2F1231299099001&amp;playerID=1217746023001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFcSbzI~,OkyYKKfkn3x1llKvCBQgVazGCPhNSKRX&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true&#34; base=&#34;http://admin.brightcove.com&#34; name=&#34;flashObj&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; seamlesstabbing=&#34;false&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowScriptAccess=&#34;always&#34; swLiveConnect=&#34;true&#34; pluginspage=&#34;http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On The Similarities Between Girls And Aliens</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I discovered, through the power of the search words that lead to my blog, that there was &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/110635974610895095726/posts/fTygidL33cx&#34;&gt;an incident at JavaOne&lt;/a&gt; that once again opens the can of worms that is Sexism In IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Makes Me Sad. &amp;nbsp;I had a really positive experience at JavaOne. &amp;nbsp;In fact, I would say it was the one conference I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in the last 12 months where I felt like my gender &lt;i&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/i&gt; a problem - I even got away with wearing hotpants (tweed is business-casual, right??) without being mistaken for anything other than a developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know incidents like this cause a lot of tension, and I want to explore why. &amp;nbsp;Get ready for some gross generalisations: women get upset because they feel they&amp;rsquo;re being marginalised or treated differently; men get upset because they think we&amp;rsquo;re being over-sensitive, especially when the cause is something unintentional. &amp;nbsp;I sometimes wonder, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure other people do, if perhaps picking up every incident harms our cause more than advancing it. &amp;nbsp;But then I feel that the&amp;nbsp;unconscious&amp;nbsp;stuff is exactly the stuff that needs to be pointed out - if you don&amp;rsquo;t realise you&amp;rsquo;re causing a problem, you can&amp;rsquo;t change your behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I wanted to do was&amp;hellip; well, what I wanted to do was not rant about gender (again) and be a good little non-gendered programmer. &amp;nbsp;But then I thought that spreading a bit of understanding might be A Good Thing. &amp;nbsp;After all, we&amp;rsquo;re all about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_improvement_process&#34;&gt;continuous improvement&lt;/a&gt;, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure many people have been one of a minority at some point in their lives (brace yourselves for a litany of stereotyping) - the only man at their daughter&amp;rsquo;s dance recital; the only white guy on a basketball team; the only straight guy in a gay bar (accidents happen!); the only girl on the development team&amp;hellip;  Speaking for myself, in those situations I&amp;rsquo;m not actually looking for things which prove that I&amp;rsquo;m Not One Of Them.  I&amp;rsquo;m sub-consciously seeking reassurance that I&amp;rsquo;m not an alien, a freak of nature, the odd one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in mostly male environments for the last 16 years - this is the norm for me, it&amp;rsquo;s my life. &amp;nbsp;It freaks me out if I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by women actually. &amp;nbsp;What&amp;rsquo;s jarring and uncomfortable is when the difference of your gender becomes apparent: when all the t-shirts are boy-shaped and boy-sized; when someone makes a joke about &amp;ldquo;women&amp;rdquo;; when someone addresses the room with &amp;ldquo;Gentlemen&amp;rdquo; - or worse, they try and make up for it: &amp;ldquo;Gentlemen. &amp;nbsp;Oh, and Ladies. &amp;nbsp;Well, Lady &amp;lt;nervous smile&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;Thanks, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me feel like an outsider &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else that really highlights the difference in genders is when you have plenty of women at the conference&amp;hellip; but they&amp;rsquo;re not the attendees. &amp;nbsp;They&amp;rsquo;re manning the booths (marketing/sales or just plain hired &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo;), they&amp;rsquo;re taking tickets, they&amp;rsquo;re dishing out the lunches. &amp;nbsp;In these cases, it becomes normal to assume that &amp;ldquo;girl&amp;rdquo; = &amp;ldquo;staff&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;Not guest. &amp;nbsp;Not equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/04/tradetech-2011-not-like-developer.html&#34;&gt;TradeTech&lt;/a&gt; was one of the worst examples of this that I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced. &amp;nbsp;Those (wo)manning the booths had been chosen for their aesthetics not their knowledge. &amp;nbsp;There was even entertainment consisting of scantily clad stilt-walkers - at a financial conference! &amp;nbsp;I made the mistake of turning up in a skirt - for those who know my dress sense, it was not one of my arse-length ones, it was just above my knees - and everyone assumed I was selling something. I had a job to persuade them that I had actually paid for my ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So. &amp;nbsp;What am I trying to get at?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not trying to make you uncomfortable when we point out tiny accidental possibly maybe sexist or sexist-seeming comments/incidents. &amp;nbsp;We&amp;rsquo;re trying to stamp out behaviour that can&amp;nbsp;subconsciously&amp;nbsp;be pushing women (or other minorities/groups) out of our industry. &amp;nbsp;We like it here, we want to stay, and we want others to join us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to alienate people who are not 100% comfortable in your environment. &amp;nbsp;Every time I see t-shirts in boys size only I&amp;rsquo;m reminded I&amp;rsquo;m Not One Of You.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;hellip;and what can we do?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, the t-shirts is an easy one. &amp;nbsp;So easy, and so stupid, you might not think it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile. &amp;nbsp;Especially as people like me don&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; your free t-shirt. &amp;nbsp;But I want to feel like you wanted me to want it. &amp;nbsp;Please stock some skinny-fit tees in multiple sizes, and stock smalls and mediums of the normal shape. &amp;nbsp;There are guys who would like this too. &amp;nbsp;Even if you can&amp;rsquo;t get rid of your skinny tees, it will do wonders for your image.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never assume your audience is all male. &amp;nbsp;Never even assume it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;mostly&amp;rdquo; male. &amp;nbsp;If your sister/girlfriend/mother/daughter might frown at something you&amp;rsquo;re saying, don&amp;rsquo;t say it. &amp;nbsp;You&amp;rsquo;ll look like an idiot. &amp;nbsp;You can assume your audience is all technical, and joke about managers, or is all Java, and take the mickey out of C#. &amp;nbsp;Don&amp;rsquo;t draw arbitrary battle lines based on gender/race/origin - any jokes should make all the audience feel included, not like specific individuals are excluded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s already been a lot said elsewhere about encouraging women speakers at events. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;m totally behind this, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fine line because I&amp;rsquo;m also totally against positive discrimination. &amp;nbsp;For the purposes of this blog, I would just say make sure you have some women on your speakers list, in the same way you would probably ensure you have a Java 7 talk, or a talk on the shiniest new technology, or other miscellaneous checkboxes you need to tick in order to make your conference a success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure what to suggest around many of the girls there being staff&amp;hellip; I guess something simple like clear uniforms would stop people assuming female delegates are there to hand out lunch. &amp;nbsp;And making sure that your staff/helpers/organisers are of both genders too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this whole topic, or want to tell me I&amp;rsquo;m wrong to my face, come along my panel at Devoxx - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Why+We+Shouldn%27t+Target+Women&#34;&gt;Why We Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Target Women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaOne 2011: Roundup</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/javaone_2011_roundup</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2011 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having been back in London for a few days I&amp;rsquo;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. &amp;nbsp;Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just not jaded yet. &amp;nbsp;But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/10/java-one-initial-observations.html&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RlwrbbMeTWI/TpWq7Aw_7OI/AAAAAAAAIQ0/UiDjINFvXjo/s1600/bruno.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;219&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RlwrbbMeTWI/TpWq7Aw_7OI/AAAAAAAAIQ0/UiDjINFvXjo/s320/bruno.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First and foremost, the people. &amp;nbsp;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember meeting a single grumpy person. Everyone I spoke to was there to get the most out of the experience, regardless of how many times they&amp;rsquo;d been previously. &amp;nbsp;In my experience, techies are not conditioned to be socially comfortable, yet&amp;nbsp;introductions were made and&amp;nbsp;the conversations flowed easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of course it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just the attendees who were friendly, the staff and organisers were approachable and helpful, and it was nice to have people hanging around to direct you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the (few) advantages of having the event over multiple hotels was the outdoor space between them. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that it rained, &amp;nbsp;but I really liked being able to hang around outside. &amp;nbsp;I especially liked that they had provided power points for your laptop, so you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be cooped up indoors to update your blog. &amp;nbsp;I also thought that having to walk between the venues was good exercise, given I didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the gym last week. However I can see why people want to move the event back to one central location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UOsWpFnYjSw/TpWrGSgqheI/AAAAAAAAIQ8/Hx8nyX5S3uA/s1600/martijn.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UOsWpFnYjSw/TpWrGSgqheI/AAAAAAAAIQ8/Hx8nyX5S3uA/s200/martijn.jpg&#34; width=&#34;177&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I personally found the sessions less useful than the networking. &amp;nbsp;I mostly attended the high-performance / concurrency sessions, but I probably should have been to ones about things I &lt;i&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/i&gt; know (e.g. other JVM languages). &amp;nbsp;My favourite session was &lt;a href=&#34;http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martijn&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; Diabolical Developer session, but then I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of stand-up comedy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another favourite was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://javaposse.com/&#34;&gt;Java Posse&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;live podcast. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed to admit that I&amp;rsquo;ve never listened to one before (my excuse: I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to podcasts at all because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a long commute to work, which would be the ideal time). &amp;nbsp;I thought it was great how everyone felt like a part of the Java Posse and not a passive audience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8az7qiRldX8/TpWro5J2Z2I/AAAAAAAAIRM/fCD-liE8g9o/s1600/javaposse.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8az7qiRldX8/TpWro5J2Z2I/AAAAAAAAIRM/fCD-liE8g9o/s320/javaposse.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really felt that Oracle was trying its best to invoke the spirit of community. &amp;nbsp;Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s because when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in sessions or having random conversations, I was in Java User Group or &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/home/index&#34;&gt;Java Community Process&lt;/a&gt; events. &amp;nbsp;It seems pretty clear to me that the inclusion of &lt;a href=&#34;http://soujava.org.br/&#34;&gt;SouJava&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; in the JCP EC has shaken things up a bit. &amp;nbsp;But then, I would say that - I&amp;rsquo;m biased. &amp;nbsp;But the vibe I was getting across the whole conference was that having the community involved in this key decision-making organisation is a step forward. &amp;nbsp;I would even go so far as to claim that it inspired a number of other players to seriously consider getting on board rather than complaining from the sidelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vuIJB2I4Elo/TpWrcuMqwoI/AAAAAAAAIRE/M8Y6MkPZW6E/s1600/jduchess.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;145&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vuIJB2I4Elo/TpWrcuMqwoI/AAAAAAAAIRE/M8Y6MkPZW6E/s320/jduchess.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a related note, I really enjoyed the final &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/ocom/groups/systemobject/@mktg_admin/documents/webcontent/videoplayer-ocom.html?bctid=1176404830001&amp;amp;playerID=single-social&amp;amp;size=events&#34;&gt;keynote on community&lt;/a&gt;. To me, that was an indication that Oracle takes our participation very seriously. &amp;nbsp;I liked that it was split into a lot of different interviews and panels, all quite short, which showcased the variety of the Java platform community. &amp;nbsp;I came out of that feeling pretty warm and fluffy about the future of our technology, and proud to be an active part of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stuff I was not so bothered about:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vendor keynotes. &amp;nbsp;Pretty dull to be honest. &amp;nbsp;I understand why they had them but after the first one I didn&amp;rsquo;t turn up to any more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The other bad points I already mentioned in the last post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Personal highlights:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aovhDAhVoKI/TpWryE1AKMI/AAAAAAAAIRU/vnwMqPGquSQ/s1600/intro-to-disruptor.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;154&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aovhDAhVoKI/TpWryE1AKMI/AAAAAAAAIRU/vnwMqPGquSQ/s200/intro-to-disruptor.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Picking up the Duke&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/ocom/groups/public/@ocom/documents/digitalasset/512339.jpg&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- note: only seems to work in Firefox for me) for &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll shut up about it at some point, let me have my moment of glory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Co-presenting a session on the Disruptor with &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;He invited me to stand up with him when we realised I could go to the event, and I was terrified of the thought. &amp;nbsp;So I did it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meeting and being interviewed by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;JDuchess&lt;/a&gt; ladies. &amp;nbsp;The video doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be available, so maybe I was rubbish, but it was a cool thing for me all the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talking about the Disruptor for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.oracle.com/javaspotlight/entry/java_spotlight_episode_51_live&#34;&gt;Java Spotlight Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the Oracle news guys (again, I can&amp;rsquo;t find the content for this yet).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had a really brilliant time, and would love to repeat the experience again as soon as possible!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve been at JavaOne for the better part of three days, it&amp;rsquo;s time to record some of my observations so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The wireless access is rubbish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;Gross generalisation&amp;gt; technical people are not natural public speakers. &amp;nbsp;Makes me feel better about the presentations I&amp;rsquo;m going to be giving (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/32877942/&#34;&gt;A Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a really excellent time, I&amp;rsquo;ve met: people from other Java User Groups; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;Duchess&lt;/a&gt; girls; other Duke Award winners; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.azulsystems.com/&#34;&gt;Azul&lt;/a&gt; guys; guys (well, girls) from O&amp;rsquo;Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone thinks that Large is an acceptable default t-shirt size (it&amp;rsquo;s not). &amp;nbsp;Vendors - if you&amp;rsquo;re really serious about appealing to The Other Gender you need to stock XS, if not actual skinny tees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a conference, you should probably have your projection screens &lt;i&gt;above&lt;/i&gt; the height of the audience members&amp;rsquo; heads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People at JavaOne are dead friendly. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up in a lot of conversations just by virtue of standing alone for longer than 30 seconds. &amp;nbsp;It is noticeably easier to talk to people here than at the conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve been attending in London. &amp;nbsp;Not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s a location thing or a domain thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socialising in London is &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/09/what-my-hangovers-can-teach-you-about.html&#34;&gt;great practice&lt;/a&gt; for this sort of event. &amp;nbsp;I am capable of taking advantage of free drink and still maintaining a conversation and staying upright in 6 inch heels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I miss American breakfasts. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve been gorging myself on pancakes, biscuits and gravy, and eggs benedict. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ll be calling my personal trainer as soon as I return.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anything to contradict my view that San Francisco is not the Brit&amp;rsquo;s typical view of California - the weather is rubbish. &amp;nbsp;London has been hotter and sunnier this week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharing an apartment with your CTO is not as weird as you might think. &amp;nbsp;Especially if you relegate him to the closet (no, that&amp;rsquo;s not a euphemism).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to remember to Tweet or blog when you&amp;rsquo;re totally engrossed in conversations with people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of me representing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; as I pick up the &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.com/en/dukeschoice/index.jsp&#34;&gt;Duke Award&lt;/a&gt; we won for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z4fj8X89gh8/TouHpDgIy4I/AAAAAAAAIKs/v_3k_WC8rCU/s1600/duke.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;313&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z4fj8X89gh8/TouHpDgIy4I/AAAAAAAAIKs/v_3k_WC8rCU/s320/duke.JPG&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt; for taking the photo).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was grabbed for an interview which should be available (un-edited - erk!) on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://java.net/&#34;&gt;java.net&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at some point, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it when it&amp;rsquo;s available (if it&amp;rsquo;s not rubbish).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
