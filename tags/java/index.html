for a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/">Java User Group</a> event in Sevilla, which surprised me as it was on a weekend,
and the weekend before the spectacle that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week_in_Seville">Semana

    Web development has changed a lot.I was aware that there have been many changes in the last few years, and I’ve seen maturity come to web platforms in the form of standardisation and common reusable libraries and frameworks - and I don’t mean reusable in the way we used to “reuse” stuff by nicking it off other people’s websites when we saw something cool.I used to be a web developer. &nbsp;Sort of.

    In the last two articles on Spock I&rsquo;ve covered mocking and stubbing. And I was pretty sold on Spock just based on that. But for a database driver, there&rsquo;s a killer feature: &nbsp;Data Driven Testing.All developers have a tendency to think of and test the happy path. Not least of all because that&rsquo;s usually the path in the User Story - &ldquo;As a customer I want to withdraw money and have the correct amount in my hand&rdquo;.

    The second in my short series of blogs about the new Java driver is now available for your perusal. &nbsp;In it, there&rsquo;s some guidance on how to get started using the new driver, whether you want to use the new (unfinished) API, the existing &ldquo;classic&rdquo; API, or a blend of both.The post also shows that Gradle is prettier than Maven. &nbsp;Sorry Maven.If you are going to play with the new driver, please read all the caveats carefully.

    I feel slightly like a traitor to my own blog, as I&rsquo;ve written a blog post for Somewhere Else. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve written about the design goals for the 3.0 MongoDB Java Driver in the official MongoDB blog (seems sensible, right?). &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about cross-posting the entire contents, so I&rsquo;m just linking you to them instead.Anyone who&rsquo;s been to my Backwards Compatibility presentation this year might notice something familiar about the content.

    In the last post I talked about our need for some improved testing tools, our choice of Spock as something to spike, and how mocking looks in Spock.As that blog got rather long, I saved the next installment for a separate post.Today I want to look at stubbing.StubbingMocking is great for checking outputs - in the example in the last post, we&rsquo;re checking that the process of encoding an array calls the right things on the way out, if you like - that the right stuff gets poked onto the bsonWriter.Stubbing is great for faking your inputs (I don&rsquo;t know why this difference never occurred to me before, but&nbsp;Colin&rsquo;s talk at Devoxx UK&nbsp;made this really clear to me).

    We&rsquo;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver. &nbsp;Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.This is not going to be the case when it comes to testing, however. &nbsp;At the very least, we&rsquo;re going to use JUnit or TestNG (we used testng in the previous version, we&rsquo;ve switched to JUnit for 3.0).

    So, like one of my presentations, I have a question for you. &nbsp;Actually, I have more than one question for you. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not going to bother with survey monkey or whatever, I want to share the answers so please, answers in the comments:Are you using the Java driver for MongoDB in your application?Are you using the Java driver directly, or are you using a third party library like Morphia, Spring Data, the Scala driver, your own abstraction layer, etc?If you&rsquo;re using a third party library, why did you choose that over using the Java driver directly?If you&rsquo;re using the Java driver directly, what do you like about it?&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re using the Java driver directly, are there any areas that give you pain?

    Don&rsquo;t you hate it when you ask a perfectly good question, and someone comes back with the answer &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;?It&rsquo;s so frustrating to think that in a world of ones and zeros, people can&rsquo;t give absolute answers and you can&rsquo;t rely on &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;.It&rsquo;s an answer I&rsquo;ve given so many times, especially when someone asks about performance. &nbsp;Well, I&rsquo;ve had my&nbsp;comeuppance. &nbsp;The entire exercise of designing the new Java driver for MongoDB has been nothing but a series of questions where the answer is &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;:Which Java version are our users, um, using?Do people want an asynchronous driver?How will they want to work with async?Will they want to use async and synchronous method calls from the same application?Do people typically use the Java driver directly, or do they use something that wraps it, like Morphia or Spring Data?What&rsquo;s most important for users in terms of performance?

    On the same day Stephen Chin came to see me at the 10gen offices, we also ran a NightHacking session in the evening with the London Java Community. &nbsp;Not many people turned up (maybe I need to work on my signage to the office?) but it was a great session. In fact, having less people meant we could all be involved.Expect Raspberry Pis and JavaFX.

    This month&rsquo;s Java Magazine&nbsp;features an article by yours truly, which is yet another intro to the Disruptor. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s basically a summary of the stuff I&rsquo;ve written in this blog, updated for version 2.7 - so the names of the classes should be up to date and the responsibilities follow the simplified pattern we use now. &nbsp;If you were looking for an more recent version of my introduction blog posts, this article gives a reasonable overview.This is intended as part one of a series, as it&rsquo;s a basic and high-level view&nbsp;with no code examples.

    Saturday was, hopefully, my last conference of the year. &nbsp;My lucky readers should start to see some posts which are not simply me gushing about another opportunity to hang out with awesome people and learn about interesting &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.Who wants to propose a session?In many ways the London Java Community Open Conference was my favourite one so far, and not just because it&rsquo;s near home and I helped to organise it. &nbsp;One of the awesome things about both Java One and Devoxx was the opportunity to travel, to see new places and to meet people you might not meet in London.

    A couple of weeks ago, I was at JAX London along with a number of the London Java Community regulars (Martijn/Ben/John/Sandro/Simon/Zoe I&rsquo;m looking at you&hellip;.)My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners talk that Mike and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me.

    Last Tuesday&nbsp;Mike and I unveiled our brand shiny new presentation: Understanding the Disruptor, a Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency. &nbsp;This was a preview of the talk we&rsquo;ll be doing at JAX London on the 2nd November.A video of the session is available, as are the slides. &nbsp;I promise not to say &ldquo;so&rdquo; anywhere near as many times when I repeat my performance at JAX (is there anything more painful than watching yourself on video?).I thought the session went really really well.

    Martin recently announced version 2.0 of the Disruptor&nbsp;- basically there have been so many changes since we first open-sourced it that it&rsquo;s time to mark that officially. &nbsp;His post goes over all the changes, the aim of this article is to attempt to translate my previous blog posts into new-world-speak, since it&rsquo;s going to take a long time to re-write each of them all over again. Now I see the disadvantage of hand-drawing everything.In the old worldThis is an example of a configuration of the Disruptor (specifically a diamond configuration).

    My recent slow-down in posting is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to write a post explaining memory barriers and their applicability in the Disruptor. The problem is, no matter how much I read and no matter how many times I ask the ever-patient Martin and Mike questions trying to clarify some point, I just don&rsquo;t intuitively grasp the subject. I guess I don&rsquo;t have the deep background knowledge required to fully understand.So, rather than make an idiot of myself trying to explain something I don&rsquo;t really get, I&rsquo;m going to try and cover, at an abstract / massive-simplification level, what I do understand in the area.

    We mention the phrase Mechanical Sympathy quite a lot, in fact it&rsquo;s even Martin&rsquo;s blog title. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s about understanding how the underlying hardware operates and programming in a way that works with that, not against it.We get a number of comments and questions about the mysterious cache line padding in the RingBuffer, and I referred to it in the last post. &nbsp;Since this lends itself to pretty pictures, it&rsquo;s the next thing I thought I would tackle.Comp Sci 101One of the things I love about working at LMAX is all that stuff I learnt at university and in my A Level Computing actually means something.

    Martin Fowler has written a really good article describing not only the Disruptor, but also how it fits into the architecture at LMAX. &nbsp;This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&rdquo;.I&rsquo;m working up to answering that. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m currently on question number two: &ldquo;Why is it so fast?&rdquo;.These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can&rsquo;t talk about why it&rsquo;s fast without saying what it does, and I can&rsquo;t talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.So I&rsquo;m trapped in a circular dependency.

    So now I&rsquo;ve covered the ring buffer itself, reading from it and writing to it.Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation. &nbsp;Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve done some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.

    This is the missing piece in the end-to-end view of the Disruptor. &nbsp;Brace yourselves, it's quite long. &nbsp;But I decided to keep it in a single blog so you could have the context in one place.The important areas are: not wrapping the ring; informing the consumers; batching for producers; and how multiple producers work.ProducerBarriersThe Disruptor code has interfaces and helper classes for the Consumers, but there's no interface for your producer, the thing that writes to the ring buffer.

    The next in the series of understanding the Disruptor pattern developed at LMAX.After the last post we all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are. &nbsp;Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you&rsquo;re using the Disruptor.ConsumerBarriers and ConsumersI&rsquo;m going to approach this slightly backwards, because it&rsquo;s probably easier to understand in the long run. &nbsp;Assuming that some magic has populated it: how do you read something from the ring buffer?

    Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. &nbsp;Why did we open source it? &nbsp;Well, we&rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&hellip; a bit wrong. We&rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it&nbsp;would be selfish not to share it with the world. &nbsp;Plus it makes us look dead clever.On the site you can download a technical article explaining what the Disruptor is and why it&rsquo;s so clever and fast.

    As an associate member of the London Java Community (LJC), I&rsquo;m very pleased with the news that we won an Open seat on the Java SE/EE executive committee. &nbsp;The results show that we got an astonishing 47.5% of the vote - if an MP got voted in with that percentage the newspapers would probably be using the word &ldquo;landslide&rdquo;.It&rsquo;s quite exciting to be one of the two user groups involved. &nbsp;We hope to balance some of the larger corporate organisations, we&rsquo;re the voice of real life Java developers who use the language every day, for enterprise development or open source projects.You can argue Java is dying, but the community is not.

    At LMAX we adopted Google Web Toolkit pretty early on. &nbsp;One of the motivations for using it was so we only had to worry about recruiting Java guys, and then we could all work on every part of the application including the web UI. &nbsp;Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.The problem is that GWT does a very nice job of pretending to be Java whilst actually compiling down to HTML and JavaScript.
