    In previous years, JAX London would have been an easy, local conference to go to. This time it took me most of Sunday to get there, and not because of the Super Storm. Still, that gave me the day to finish off the tutorial I was running there on Monday morning. Not that I would be so unprofessional as to leave preparing things until the last minute, oh no&hellip;. But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java Community.

    Saturday I had the pleasure of being part of the 5th London Java Community Open Conference. &nbsp;This is a great event to end the conference season on - it made me feel good about being part of the LJC, and &nbsp;got me excited about the prospects for 2013.The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&rsquo;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&rsquo;t expect to.Given how much I&rsquo;ve been presenting lately, and with the conferences piling on top of each other back-to-back leaving little time for preparation, I had decided not to speak at the open conference, but to sit and learn for a change - it&rsquo;s a great opportunity for new speakers to present for a start.

    On the same day Stephen Chin came to see me at the 10gen offices, we also ran a NightHacking session in the evening with the London Java Community. &nbsp;Not many people turned up (maybe I need to work on my signage to the office?) but it was a great session. In fact, having less people meant we could all be involved.Expect Raspberry Pis and JavaFX.

    Seemed like a quiet conference this year. &nbsp;Not really sure why, maybe it was the layout of the massive (and extremely dark) main room; maybe it was the awkward L-shape of the communal space; or maybe this year people were more interested in listening to the (really very good) sessions rather than participating or meeting other people. &nbsp;Whatever the reason, it felt quiet and almost low-key.Performance seemed pretty high on the agenda, as you&rsquo;d expect from a London conference, with a number of things on offer:A great keynote from Kirk Pepperdine and Martijn Verburg, covering a massive range of things to care about when thinking about performance on the first nightA high-level talk about Java Performance from yours truly (which I may run again for the LJC if there&rsquo;s interest, but it&rsquo;s more likely to be a one-off)A deep dive into writing lock-free coding by Mike BarkerAnd a talk from Kirk exploring your GC logs.It was great to see a number of LJC regulars presenting, especially as my own schedule has been so crazy I haven&rsquo;t seen many of them for a long time.

    Well this is exciting! &nbsp;JavaOne 2011 is the first conference I spoke at, so this the first time I&rsquo;ve covered the same conference two years running. &nbsp;I think.It&rsquo;s very nice to be back at JavaOne. &nbsp;Last year&nbsp;it was my first opportunity to meet so many people - the guys at Oracle who work really hard to make sure Java has its own identity; the JUG Leaders and Duchess folk; the JCP EC committee members; and loads of people who live and work in the area who I wouldn&rsquo;t normally get a chance to speak to in person.This year I&rsquo;m here with several other&nbsp;London Java Community&nbsp;people, and it&rsquo;s great to be a member of the Alumni, to have the privilege of showing other guys around and introducing people to each other.

    Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to&nbsp;present to a brand new community of developers. &nbsp;I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&rsquo;d never given a presentation in a pub.

    Saturday was, hopefully, my last conference of the year. &nbsp;My lucky readers should start to see some posts which are not simply me gushing about another opportunity to hang out with awesome people and learn about interesting &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.Who wants to propose a session?In many ways the London Java Community Open Conference was my favourite one so far, and not just because it&rsquo;s near home and I helped to organise it. &nbsp;One of the awesome things about both Java One and Devoxx was the opportunity to travel, to see new places and to meet people you might not meet in London.

    Stephan wearing the Brazilian flag at the opening keynoteEuropean conferences are different (and cool) because you get to hear even more languages spoken than you usually do in London (apparently the most diverse city in the world for spoken languages). &nbsp;I think the idea of a Paris Devoxx with 75% of the talks in French is brilliant - I&rsquo;m always banging on about diversity, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect developers to learn&nbsp;in English only.Really great to meet up with some of the people I met at Java One and am starting to feel more a part of the global community.Seems to me there are slightly more women here than at the other conferences I&rsquo;ve been to, and not just because Regina and I pulled together four women for a panel on women technologists.

    A couple of weeks ago, I was at JAX London along with a number of the London Java Community regulars (Martijn/Ben/John/Sandro/Simon/Zoe I&rsquo;m looking at you&hellip;.)My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners talk that Mike and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me.

    Having been back in London for a few days I&rsquo;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. &nbsp;Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&rsquo;m just not jaded yet. &nbsp;But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):First and foremost, the people. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t remember meeting a single grumpy person.

    Remember a while back I talked about my first public appearance?Well, I chased down the video, because I&rsquo;m masochistic, and here it is for you all to enjoy. &nbsp;Pleasingly my mannerisms are slightly less of a camp man trapped in a woman&rsquo;s body, which was my impression the last time I saw myself presenting. &nbsp;It helps that YouTube has made the video so dark you can&rsquo;t see me.Slides are available for all to enjoy.Special thanks to Playfish for hosting the event - as always, their hospitality was awesome.

    I&rsquo;m finally moving up from working behind the scenes to actually doing a (short) presentation for the LJC. I&rsquo;m going to be giving a lightning talk on Wednesday at the AWS Elastic Beanstalk event,&nbsp;on&nbsp;the JCP - what it is and what our election to the executive committee means. &nbsp;Ben and Martin&rsquo;s post&nbsp;gives a little more background on the subject.Another LMAX LJC member&nbsp;Mike will also be giving a lightning talk, on

    I&rsquo;m honoured to now be listed on three aggregated blog feeds:The new and somewhat embryonic blogs.lmax.com.The London Java Community Aggrity.ThoughtWorks Alumni, along with a whole host of distinguished names.The pressure&rsquo;s on to try and write useful stuff. &nbsp;Oh OK, I&rsquo;ll settle for &ldquo;entertaining&rdquo;.

    As an associate member of the London Java Community (LJC), I&rsquo;m very pleased with the news that we won an Open seat on the Java SE/EE executive committee. &nbsp;The results show that we got an astonishing 47.5% of the vote - if an MP got voted in with that percentage the newspapers would probably be using the word &ldquo;landslide&rdquo;.It&rsquo;s quite exciting to be one of the two user groups involved. &nbsp;We hope to balance some of the larger corporate organisations, we&rsquo;re the voice of real life Java developers who use the language every day, for enterprise development or open source projects.You can argue Java is dying, but the community is not.
