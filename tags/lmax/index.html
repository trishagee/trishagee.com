    If you see anything about LMAX - the Disruptor, Continuous Delivery, or even the selection criteria for hiring developers, you&rsquo;ll see that LMAX is pretty keen on Agile. &nbsp;However, no-one&rsquo;s documented the Agile process there, as far as I know. &nbsp;Although I personally had it on my todo list, I never had the motivation, the hook to do it. &nbsp;And I realised eventually that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a process that would work very well for another team, in another company, working in another business.The agile process followed at LMAX is one that works for the individuals and the organisation there.

    I&rsquo;m late with my write-up of QCon, and what&rsquo;s worse, it will be partial - &ldquo;sadly&rdquo; I was in Lanzarote on a training week with the running club from the Thursday (8th) so I missed most of it.&nbsp; A sacrifice I had to make for 7 days in the sunshine….Firstly, me me meI presented the talk I previewed at Skillsmatter the previous week, something I was calling the User&rsquo;s Guide to the Disruptor, but actually turned out to be how-can-Trish-fill-95-slides-with-pictures-and-finish-in-under-40-minutes.The audience was different to the Skillsmatter event, not surprisingly.&nbsp; What was surprising is that I expected people at the conference to be less aware of the Disruptor, and those who came to the Disruptor-only LJC event to have had more exposure to it.&nbsp; It was a (pleasant) surprise to see how many of the standing-room-only audience had not only heard of the Disruptor but had read stuff about it (I always love it when people have read my blog), played with it and were even using it in anger.Because of that, I think if anything the talk did not go into enough detail, or enough new stuff, to please everyone.&nbsp; Tough crowd!&nbsp; But it was gratifying to hear the audience correct me in some of my answers, and answer other people&rsquo;s questions - it&rsquo;s always nice to know people are listening.Of course, I will post a link to the presentation when it&rsquo;s available.

    My recent slow-down in posting is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to write a post explaining memory barriers and their applicability in the Disruptor. The problem is, no matter how much I read and no matter how many times I ask the ever-patient Martin and Mike questions trying to clarify some point, I just don&rsquo;t intuitively grasp the subject. I guess I don&rsquo;t have the deep background knowledge required to fully understand.So, rather than make an idiot of myself trying to explain something I don&rsquo;t really get, I&rsquo;m going to try and cover, at an abstract / massive-simplification level, what I do understand in the area.

    We mention the phrase Mechanical Sympathy quite a lot, in fact it&rsquo;s even Martin&rsquo;s blog title. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s about understanding how the underlying hardware operates and programming in a way that works with that, not against it.We get a number of comments and questions about the mysterious cache line padding in the RingBuffer, and I referred to it in the last post. &nbsp;Since this lends itself to pretty pictures, it&rsquo;s the next thing I thought I would tackle.Comp Sci 101One of the things I love about working at LMAX is all that stuff I learnt at university and in my A Level Computing actually means something.

    Martin Fowler has written a really good article describing not only the Disruptor, but also how it fits into the architecture at LMAX. &nbsp;This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&rdquo;.I&rsquo;m working up to answering that. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m currently on question number two: &ldquo;Why is it so fast?&rdquo;.These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can&rsquo;t talk about why it&rsquo;s fast without saying what it does, and I can&rsquo;t talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.So I&rsquo;m trapped in a circular dependency.

    So now I&rsquo;ve covered the ring buffer itself, reading from it and writing to it.Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation. &nbsp;Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve done some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.

    This is the missing piece in the end-to-end view of the Disruptor. &nbsp;Brace yourselves, it's quite long. &nbsp;But I decided to keep it in a single blog so you could have the context in one place.The important areas are: not wrapping the ring; informing the consumers; batching for producers; and how multiple producers work.ProducerBarriersThe Disruptor code has interfaces and helper classes for the Consumers, but there's no interface for your producer, the thing that writes to the ring buffer.

    The next in the series of understanding the Disruptor pattern developed at LMAX.After the last post we all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are. &nbsp;Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you&rsquo;re using the Disruptor.ConsumerBarriers and ConsumersI&rsquo;m going to approach this slightly backwards, because it&rsquo;s probably easier to understand in the long run. &nbsp;Assuming that some magic has populated it: how do you read something from the ring buffer?

    Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. &nbsp;Why did we open source it? &nbsp;Well, we&rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&hellip; a bit wrong. We&rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it&nbsp;would be selfish not to share it with the world. &nbsp;Plus it makes us look dead clever.On the site you can download a technical article explaining what the Disruptor is and why it&rsquo;s so clever and fast.

    On Wednesday I tagged along to the STAC London Summit to provide backup for Mike, who was on the &ldquo;The Future of Messaging Middleware&rdquo; panel.The panel consisted of two messaging providers, one hardware (Solace Systems) and one software (29West/Informatica), and two &ldquo;users&rdquo;, Citihub and LMAX. &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously both providers were arguing that theirs was the best solution. But what I found interesting is that I came away with the impression that everyone was really on the same side - everyone wants to use or to provide the best system, but there are different approaches.

    I have been struggling with .NET.&nbsp; Actually, I have been fighting pitched battles with it.All I want to do is take our existing Java client example code and write an equivalent in C#.&nbsp; Easy, right?Trisha&rsquo;s Guide to Converting Java to C#Turns out writing the actual C# is relatively straightforward.&nbsp; Putting to one side the question of writing optimal code (these are very basic samples after all), to get the examples to compile and run was a simple process:1.

    I attended TradeTech last week, an annual event about Equities and Derivatives trading. I assumed from the title that there would be a reasonable focus on technology, but I found it was more “Trade” and less “Tech”.The fascinating thing to me was how different this is from the sorts of technology conferences I&rsquo;ve been to. For example, I popped into JAX this week (albeit in the evening for drinks). At technology conferences (&lt;gross-generalisation&gt;) people tend to subscribe to a variety of dress codes and fashion clans, usually from jeans through the range of business casual, including your fair share of goths and alternatives.

    At LMAX we adopted Google Web Toolkit pretty early on. &nbsp;One of the motivations for using it was so we only had to worry about recruiting Java guys, and then we could all work on every part of the application including the web UI. &nbsp;Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.The problem is that GWT does a very nice job of pretending to be Java whilst actually compiling down to HTML and JavaScript.

    We went live with &quot;real&quot; customers this week just gone. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the culmination of nearly two years work for me personally, and three years for our company.It&rsquo;s really nice to be live at last, and to have our name out there. It might (in fact, should) change the focus of our work. Without paying customers it&rsquo;s much more difficult to prioritise work based on what they might need or want.Exciting times for LMAX!
