      <description>&lt;p&gt;How important to you is your working environment? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Type of desk &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- What&amp;rsquo;s on it &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Position / type of mouse, keyboard, monitor(s) &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Music / background sound (or lack of it) &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Open plan vs team room vs cube vs personal office &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- etc&amp;hellip; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These physical items could be extended to include your virtual environment: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Eclipse / IntelliJ Idea / Visual Studio (is it still called this?) / other dev enviornment - setup, preferences, window positions &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- OS &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Desktop icons - do you care what / how many / positioning &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Which software is always open when you&amp;rsquo;re working, and does it matter what order you open them in (so they&amp;rsquo;re in the correct place on your task bar) (additional: does not having enough RAM&amp;nbsp;cripple you because you have to constantly shut and re-open software?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How anal are you about setting these things up and getting them &lt;em&gt;just right&lt;/em&gt; before you can start coding (or whatever it is you do)? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post comes to you courtesy of my irritation with my chair.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;want to code cross-legged today and my chair does not adjust in the dimension required to provide me with enough space to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
