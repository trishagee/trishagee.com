      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. My 4th QCon London.&amp;nbsp; That’s not bad.&amp;nbsp; And every time, it’s a different experience (if you must, see my blogs for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/qcon-day-one.html&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2012/03/qcon-london-2012.html&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, and even 2007 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-initial-thoughts.html&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-todo-list-inspired-by-conference.html&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; - how cute was I? &amp;ldquo;agile seems like a jolly good idea; automated testing appears to be important&amp;rdquo;)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I can’t even tell you what I did on the first day, I was mostly panicking about my presentation - I was inspired after my trip to New York last month to change my talk at the last (responsible?) minute and do a live coding session, something much more technical than my recent talks.&amp;nbsp; I’ll leave the details for a separate blog post though, when the video comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that stands out for me from Wednesday though was Damian Conway programming &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_Game_of_Life&#34;&gt;Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; in Klingon.&amp;nbsp; Yeah.&amp;nbsp; Just find the video and watch it, the man is a genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12947751623/player/f7e8167be5&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The Thursday keynote was inspiring too from a totally different point of view - Tim Lister of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DY5A8X2/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00DY5A8X2&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Peopleware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00DY5A8X2&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; fame shared stories from his career, and I came away from that really happy I work as a technologist, but with an increased desire to learn off other amazing people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12966704755/player/7193594b96&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;On Thursday I hosted the&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/sets/72157641948363514/with/12970259753/&#34;&gt;Not Only Java&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;nbsp;track - I’m on the programme committee for QCon, and this year we wanted to cover&amp;nbsp;leading edge technologies (as always) but we didn’t want to slice things into strict technology silos [interruption: argh! the person in front of me nearly destroyed my laptop by suddenly moving their chair back! Why do people bother in economy on a morning flight?]. &amp;nbsp;So I wanted the Java track to be more representative of what today’s Java programmers care about - for the programmers of course, but also because I know there are architects and team leads at QCon who might not realise how things have moved on with the language, and how much polyglot programming we do these days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com.es/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; kicked it off with a great history lesson on the progress (or occasionally,&amp;nbsp; lack of it) in Java.&amp;nbsp; He begged us to study and understand Set Theory, to use async design, to think of the users of our APIs, and, most of all, to design nice, clean code.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Next up, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EvaAndreasson&#34;&gt;Eva&lt;/a&gt; took us through the fundamentals of Garbage Collection - this might not seem like a cutting edge subject these days, but it’s one of the most misunderstood subjects for Java programmers.&amp;nbsp; Eva gave us a really great, understandable view of the different types of garbage collectors, how they work, and their pros and cons.&amp;nbsp; She left us with a call to arms to not simply let other people try and solve this problem, but to get stuck in and contribute ourselves, via the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/&#34;&gt;OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12970531704/player/e2c2f63b43&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch was my nerve-wracking live coding session, putting together a full stack end-to-end web app using AngularJS, HTML5, Java and MongoDB.&amp;nbsp; It only went wrong twice, and people seemed to like it.&amp;nbsp; I’ll post the video in another blog post as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s publicly available. &amp;nbsp;Code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito&#34;&gt;available on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;We’ve been playing with the open spaces idea at QCon.&amp;nbsp; The Java one only had a few people in it, but that gave everyone a chance to speak at least.&amp;nbsp; We covered Java 8 (the Good and the Bad); other JVM languages; and UIs for Java (Javascript or GWT?).&amp;nbsp; And I plugged the work the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; does in London, of course.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;After this &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodil.org/&#34;&gt;Bodil&lt;/a&gt; blew me away creating a My Little Pony game using &lt;a href=&#34;https://rx.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;RX&lt;/a&gt; in the browser.&amp;nbsp; ‘Nuff said.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/speakjava&#34;&gt;Simon Ritter&lt;/a&gt; gave us a view of the Java 8&amp;nbsp; features most likely to impact the way Java developers think about software design - lambdas and streams.&amp;nbsp; I thought this was a really great introduction to the concepts if you haven’t seen them before, and with concrete examples that showed how we should be using them. &amp;nbsp;If you&amp;rsquo;re not already looking at lambdas and streams, you should be - even if you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be using Java 8 yet, it&amp;rsquo;s worth getting a heads up on how it&amp;rsquo;s going to impact our programming style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I’m very pleased with the way the Java track turned out on the day - every speaker was first class, a wide range of topics was covered, and I, for one, learnt something in every presentation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;To finish off the day, Emma Langman gave an awesome keynote about how people are the messy bit of your system, and how they’re never rational and you shouldn’t expect them to be.&amp;nbsp; I also highly recommend this talk, especially if you’re a techy and you’ve found yourself in some sort of management or team lead position.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Sadly I couldn’t stay for day three of the conference, I had to fly off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2014/03/the-joy-of-coding.html&#34;&gt;Joy of Coding&lt;/a&gt; to re-give the live coding presentation there.&amp;nbsp; Because, if you’re going to do something terrifying and doomed to failure, you might as well do it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QCon is an expensive conference, especially compared to the developer-friendly prices of something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.co.uk/&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;, but for getting a big picture of where the industry is, of things you might be missing, for learning hard core technical skills and understanding the important of the fluffy-people-stuff, and finally for meeting a wide range of people from developers to CTOs, I think you&amp;rsquo;d be hard pushed to find something better in London. &amp;nbsp;IMHO (and remember, I did disclose I&amp;rsquo;m on the programme committee). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although it&amp;rsquo;s really hard work putting together the programme for a track like this, and although both times I&amp;rsquo;ve said I&amp;rsquo;m Never Doing It Again, when it goes this well it makes you want to do it all over again. &amp;nbsp;After a break. &amp;nbsp;A looong break.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. &amp;nbsp;Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. &amp;nbsp;We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&amp;rsquo;s going through the interviewer&amp;rsquo;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/job-interview-tips#.UiBS9_WZJyU.blogger&#34;&gt;Hire Education - Making Interviews Rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of funny because we talk a lot about hiring at ThoughtWorks (where we both worked, and which has one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/hardest-tech-company-job-interviews-2012-8&#34;&gt;toughest interview processes&lt;/a&gt; in the industry) and LMAX, which learnt a lot off ThoughtWorks and shaped its own process for a smaller company that has different goals. &amp;nbsp;Yet neither of us work at those places now. &amp;nbsp;Still, we share stories from many of the places we&amp;rsquo;ve worked (or chose not to work), and if there&amp;rsquo;s one take-home point, it&amp;rsquo;s that hiring (and being hired) is not a simple thing to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like QCon London, I really do. &amp;nbsp;Not only is it on home turf, but, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/qcon-london-2012.html&#34;&gt;as I&amp;rsquo;ve said before&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just focus on technology, or a set of technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t0Q7ewOcjVk/UTfM32qZNcI/AAAAAAAALZ4/Hg0KDsMxPqA/s1600/2013-03-05+16.35.12.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t0Q7ewOcjVk/UTfM32qZNcI/AAAAAAAALZ4/Hg0KDsMxPqA/s640/2013-03-05+16.35.12.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in planning QCon this year. &amp;nbsp;So this time I know all the thinking, hard work, planning and last-minute changes that go into a conference like this. &amp;nbsp;And it&amp;rsquo;s a joy to be able to sit in the audience and see the conference that you&amp;rsquo;ve helped build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are things I took out of today that I want to get down on &amp;ldquo;paper&amp;rdquo; now, because I think the next few days will have different themes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Not Forget About Computer Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m so pleased to see this in a conference! &amp;nbsp;After documenting and talking about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/disruptor&#34;&gt;Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; so much last year, I felt it was important for us to go back to our roots a bit, and have some &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Mechanical Sympathy&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Some of the sessions today brought us back to the school room and had us thinking about the tools we&amp;rsquo;re using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my new role I&amp;rsquo;m doing something I&amp;rsquo;ve never had to do before, and that&amp;rsquo;s writing a library that will be used by other developers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/speaker/Barbara+Liskov&#34;&gt;Barbara Liskov&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; keynote had me thinking hard about &amp;ldquo;readability over writability&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;design for the case that is used most often&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;I also came out slightly depressed that some things hadn&amp;rsquo;t changed in 40 years. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Martin Thompson&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; talk made me wish I had written my driver performance tests up front, and poked me to continue thinking about our users&amp;rsquo; performance needs. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;d like to say &lt;a href=&#34;http://damian.conway.org/About_us/Bio_formal.html&#34;&gt;Damian Conway&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; keynote made me want to code in Latin, but in fact it motivated me to get back to learning Spanish. &amp;nbsp;But it also (unintentionally) backed up a point I&amp;rsquo;ve heard before, which is that programming is at least twice as hard to learn if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak English. &amp;nbsp;Probably worse if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak a European language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the message I took from the combination of these sessions is that it&amp;rsquo;s almost more important than ever to get back to basics. &amp;nbsp;Stop obsessing about frameworks and tools and different flavoured JVM languages. &amp;nbsp;Start remembering all these things are tools, that they run on machines that work with ones and zeros. &amp;nbsp;Whatever abstractions we&amp;rsquo;re using, we will write better, cleaner, more performant, fit-for-purpose code if we understand our tools, and their strengths and weaknesses. &amp;nbsp;One of these tools is even our own brain - understand how it shapes the information and presents us with solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Art Is Awesome (and Useful)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went a bit off topic to go to two sessions on visual information. &amp;nbsp;My excuse is that this blog needs more pictures, and I want more visual ways of representing what&amp;rsquo;s going on with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;/the driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aG1cjS5pg1A/UTfWgtAGD3I/AAAAAAAALaI/SFUo828A-DU/s1600/Notes+5+(page+1).png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;331&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aG1cjS5pg1A/UTfWgtAGD3I/AAAAAAAALaI/SFUo828A-DU/s400/Notes+5+(page+1).png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/speaker/Heather+Willems&#34;&gt;Heather Willem&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; session encouraged us to doodle throughout. &amp;nbsp;In fact, forced us to. &amp;nbsp;Right up front she adresses the fact that doodling is seen as a lack of attention, as a waste of time. &amp;nbsp;And I realised, sitting there in the audience with my iPad and stylus, that I did feel guilty drawing away while someone talked at me. &amp;nbsp;But it was a brilliant exercise in unblocking some of those creative juices, and letting us see the power in visual information. &amp;nbsp;Perfect is not important, pictures are powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLTnBK3ghYc/UTfKjTqIYSI/AAAAAAAALZo/uHIDDa-gxn4/s1600/Notes+5+(page+2).png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;330&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLTnBK3ghYc/UTfKjTqIYSI/AAAAAAAALZo/uHIDDa-gxn4/s400/Notes+5+(page+2).png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fernando Orellana is an artist fascinated by building machines to create art. &amp;nbsp;It was awesome to see an artist who also builds robots and codes stuff to do what he wants. &amp;nbsp;He said &amp;ldquo;code is like paint, I use it to create&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;See? I &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; coding was a creative activity. &amp;nbsp;He&amp;rsquo;s done some stuff that I probably would have been tempted to say &amp;ldquo;is that art?&amp;rdquo;, like aiming to create &lt;a href=&#34;http://fernandoorellana.com/projects/extruder/&#34;&gt;40 000 play doh cars&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Or making creepy rodents that live in &amp;ldquo;dumb little&amp;nbsp;suburban&amp;nbsp;homes&amp;rdquo; out of singing hamster toys. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fernandoorellana.com/&#34;&gt;Go to his website&lt;/a&gt; and watch the videos, nothing else can describe it. &amp;nbsp;I was blown away, it was inspiring. &amp;nbsp;And useful too for sparking creativity in all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iZxEdZOP1k4/UTfKqXejghI/AAAAAAAALZw/epR56z099yQ/s1600/Notes+5+(page+14).png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;331&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iZxEdZOP1k4/UTfKqXejghI/AAAAAAAALZw/epR56z099yQ/s400/Notes+5+(page+14).png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my &amp;ldquo;subconscious&amp;nbsp;drawing&amp;rdquo; from the start of the session. &amp;nbsp;We need more child-like art in our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two sessions really rekindled my desire to do arty, drawing-y creative stuff. &amp;nbsp;And helped me see how fear blocks many of us from using this medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And&amp;hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in the audience as an attendee, different things jump out at you. &amp;nbsp;I was shocked, as someone who&amp;rsquo;s been involved in suggesting and selecting speakers, at how few women there were again on this first day. &amp;nbsp;My thought was, how could this happen with me on the committee?? &amp;nbsp;So I have more sympathy for conference organisers than I did, when facing this tough problem, but more conviction than ever that we need to do something different to showcase different types of role models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it might be my imagination or wishful thinking, but the overall diversity of the attendees seemed much greater than recent years, which is a Good Thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for bringing up this subject again, but you might consider it blind of me not to notice something in a conference I&amp;rsquo;ve actually worked on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But overall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really impressed with the first day of the conference. &amp;nbsp;Not only was it, of course, a great opportunity to meet new people, catch up with old friends, and generally network, the sessions that I went to were excellent, and have me excited to be working in this industry, at this time. &amp;nbsp;And to be in a position to hear about it all. &amp;nbsp;And maybe, just maybe, contribute something of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m late with my write-up of &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/&#34;&gt;QCon&lt;/a&gt;, and what&amp;rsquo;s worse, it will be partial - &amp;ldquo;sadly&amp;rdquo; I was in Lanzarote on a training week with the running club from the Thursday (8th) so I missed most of it.&amp;nbsp; A sacrifice I had to make for 7 days in the sunshine….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Firstly, me me me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I presented the talk I &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/new-disruptor-presentation-unveiled-to.html&#34;&gt;previewed at Skillsmatter&lt;/a&gt; the previous week, something I was calling the User&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Disruptor, but actually turned out to be how-can-Trish-fill-95-slides-with-pictures-and-finish-in-under-40-minutes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The audience was different to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://skillsmatter.com/&#34;&gt;Skillsmatter&lt;/a&gt; event, not surprisingly.&amp;nbsp; What was surprising is that I expected people at the conference to be less aware of &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;, and those who came to the Disruptor-only LJC event to have had more exposure to it.&amp;nbsp; It was a (pleasant) surprise to see how many of the standing-room-only audience had not only heard of the Disruptor but had &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/disruptor&#34;&gt;read stuff about it&lt;/a&gt; (I always love it when people have read my blog), played with it and were even using it in anger.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Because of that, I think if anything the talk did not go into enough detail, or enough new stuff, to please everyone.&amp;nbsp; Tough crowd!&amp;nbsp; But it was gratifying to hear the audience correct me in some of my answers, and answer other people&amp;rsquo;s questions - it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to know people are listening.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Of course, I will post a link to the presentation when it&amp;rsquo;s available. &amp;nbsp;For now only the &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/TrishaGee_ConcurrentProgrammingUsingTheDisruptor.pdf&#34;&gt;slides are online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I enjoyed QCon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;QCon was noticeably different to the other conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in the last six months.&amp;nbsp; For one, it&amp;rsquo;s not a Java conference - sure, I was hosted on the Java track, but QCon is wider-ranging than just one technology platform.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s because of this, or because it was based in the notoriously impatient London, but I felt like there was a message of &amp;ldquo;Look, let&amp;rsquo;s just get stuff done, OK?&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; Ultimately we get paid to deliver stuff for the business, and since my favourite question is always &amp;ldquo;but what are we trying to achieve?&amp;rdquo; I like to hear ideas around how to actually deliver.&amp;nbsp; Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;ve loved the technology conferences - I like to hear about new stuff I had no idea about, and I really like the community vibe from them.&amp;nbsp; But it&amp;rsquo;s a nice change to be shaken up into thinking exactly &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; we do all this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Data Panorama&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Firstly, Rebecca Parsons and &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt; from my old employer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; put Big Data into perspective.&amp;nbsp; Previously I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really cared about it - we process lots of data at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; but we don&amp;rsquo;t really have to dig into it, so Big Data is not top of my &amp;ldquo;oooh I really worry about that&amp;rdquo; problems.&amp;nbsp; There were quite a few interesting points I took out of this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6XxOlBvbMg/T3F3oFTMPFI/AAAAAAAAJlk/1uaS3_A3ozs/s1600/2012-03-07+09.58.29.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6XxOlBvbMg/T3F3oFTMPFI/AAAAAAAAJlk/1uaS3_A3ozs/s320/2012-03-07+09.58.29.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;- In the past, it was easy (and possibly even correct) to model the whole application based on the data you were collecting or manipulating (and probably storing in a relational database).&amp;nbsp; These days it&amp;rsquo;s not just the data from your app you need to worry about (and that can get big enough), but also all the news, blogs, twitter, and Facebook stuff generated by you and about you.&amp;nbsp; In addition, your data might not even be located with your app - the cloud has made the physical question of location redundant.&amp;nbsp; All of this pushes you towards an architecture which has to separate data from the application, and forces you to ponder your design.&amp;nbsp; I heard good arguments for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00794TAUG/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00794TAUG&#34;&gt;Domain Driven Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00794TAUG&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; here, which is nice because we like that at LMAX.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Reporting and analytics on Big Data must be more fluid.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;rsquo;s so much data about you, your users, your application, out there that you don&amp;rsquo;t even know the questions to ask.&amp;nbsp; Instead you want to be able to spot patterns in data you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know you had,&amp;nbsp; I thought this was dead interesting - I studied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at university, and we were told data mining using AI was going to be fundamental to companies who wanted to be on the bleeding edge.&amp;nbsp; Only now is it looking like people realise it&amp;rsquo;s becoming that important.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Martin referred to Data Scientists and said he was suspicious of scientists.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;d been reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139XTG4/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00139XTG4&#34;&gt;The Black Swan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00139XTG4&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; on the train in that morning and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if he&amp;rsquo;s read the same thing - that was talking about how you should treat someone with suspicion if they suggest you can apply science and logic to anything that is… well, actually to anything other than actual science (by which he meant physics I believe).&amp;nbsp; By saying it&amp;rsquo;s a science you suggest it&amp;rsquo;s predictable and follows rules.&amp;nbsp; And if it was predictable, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard.&amp;nbsp; Big Data is anything other than predictable - the data could be corrupt (it&amp;rsquo;s safest to assume some of it is); it&amp;rsquo;s generated by people (and we all know how fickle they are); and if you&amp;rsquo;re collecting lots of it practically randomly, then cause/effect/correlation are not guaranteed.&amp;nbsp; So Martin suggests the term Data Journalist.&amp;nbsp; There was a storm on Twitter which suggested a certain amount of disagreement with this term, but I like it.&amp;nbsp; But then, I like to pretend I&amp;rsquo;m a writer and not a programmer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- They gave some examples of using data to drive economic growth (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://opendata.go.ke/&#34;&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;) - what I thought was interesting about this is that it was a win-win situation - expose the data to grow technology skills, but get a lot of interesting/useful/socially responsible applications in return.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Something I liked was about the idea of embracing &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; data, stuff that&amp;rsquo;s not trustworthy for whatever reason.&amp;nbsp; You can assume that the good data overwhelms the bad but you can&amp;rsquo;t be sure.&amp;nbsp; By looking for more fluffy patterns, vague correlations, in your data, you might expose something interesting even if the data&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; As humans, we can&amp;rsquo;t expect that we won&amp;rsquo;t make a mistake - it&amp;rsquo;s better assume we will and work out how to deal with it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- There was a call to not passively accept requirements, but to play an active role.&amp;nbsp; I like to think this ties in to my post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/why-customer-isnt-always-right.html&#34;&gt;working with your customer&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; But then I would.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- I got a lot from this keynote, even if it was just a feeling of &amp;ldquo;I knew it!&amp;nbsp; I was right!&amp;ldquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highly available systems in Erlang&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Joe Armstrong was a very interesting person to listen to, clearly someone who&amp;rsquo;s been there and done that. Even without the presentation, &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/JoeArmstrong_BuildingHighlyAvailableSystemsInErlang.pdf&#34;&gt;the slides&lt;/a&gt; are interesting in their own right as they contain a lot of information and guidelines.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The points I took away are:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- If part of the system fails, it&amp;rsquo;s not up to that part to fix itself.&amp;nbsp; You need special help to deal with failures.&amp;nbsp; If you fell over with a heart attack, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t try and heal yourself, you&amp;rsquo;d get a medic&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Isolation between threads/programs will mean that those different things cannot interfere with each other (i.e. no shared state).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- My favourite quote was &amp;ldquo;If you make things synchronous you&amp;rsquo;ll bugger things up&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; In theory, it&amp;rsquo;s so much easier for us humans (programmers) to think synchronously.&amp;nbsp; But whenever you design your system to by asynchronous, you find that your system actually becomes simpler and not more complicated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;JVM performance optimizations at Twitter&amp;rsquo;s scale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- I had a terrible view in the fully packed room, so I was just picking up phrases. I heard&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/asz&#34;&gt;Attila&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;mention the Uncanny Valley, a phenomenon I was introduced to by my sister when she was studying her Cybernetics PhD (Google it, I found it fascinating). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- There was a lot of really useful information about how the Java GC works.&amp;nbsp; It seemed to back up the (rough) premise we work on - stuff that&amp;rsquo;s very short-lived is fine, and stuff that lasts &amp;ldquo;forever&amp;rdquo; is fine - it&amp;rsquo;s the stuff in between which&amp;nbsp; cripples your system when it keeps getting shoved around.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decisions Decisions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dannorth.net/&#34;&gt;Dan North&lt;/a&gt; was, as always, an excellent speaker.&amp;nbsp; He entertained us but got us all thinking.&amp;nbsp; Five years ago at QCon London (my very first conference ever, and the thing that motivated me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2007/03/qcon-london.html&#34;&gt;start a professional blog&lt;/a&gt;), I saw Dan speaking and I was inspired to think about my working practices.&amp;nbsp; He was talking about BDD at the time, which was a relatively new concept to me.&amp;nbsp; I came away from that QCon with clearer ideas of what awesome development practices should look like.&amp;nbsp; Never did I imagine that five years later, not only would I be working in an environment which follows a lot of those practices (and pioneers many more) but that I would actually be speaking at the same conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dSflRhQmCtU/T3F3eta5bUI/AAAAAAAAJlU/TSJDG-V23Ck/s1600/2012-03-07+16.47.15.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dSflRhQmCtU/T3F3eta5bUI/AAAAAAAAJlU/TSJDG-V23Ck/s320/2012-03-07+16.47.15.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way since then, and of course, Dan isn&amp;rsquo;t talking about the same things either. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a lot of conferences this year, and I heard nothing really preaching to the &amp;ldquo;meta-agile&amp;rdquo; LMAX (still have a post pending about our agile practices&amp;hellip;).&amp;nbsp; When it comes to agile, there seem to be very few people who we can learn off - don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, there are lots of things we want to improve on, which is why we&amp;rsquo;re looking for people to learn off.&amp;nbsp; But most people are still preaching TDD and we want to know &amp;ldquo;what next?&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Well, Dan took everything we thought we knew, and ripped it to pieces.&amp;nbsp; Taught us to challenge everything we think we know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;It was irritating actually because he had no answers.&amp;nbsp; But he did tell us that the answers we think we already have might not be the right ones….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Well worth watching his talk when it comes online, I really can&amp;rsquo;t summarise it here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developers Have a Mental Disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I nearly missed this ending keynote.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;nbsp;Greg Young&amp;nbsp;is awesome at ranting.&amp;nbsp; He said developers have a disease - we overcomplicate things, when we try to simplify things.&amp;nbsp; We want to abstract stuff, we love to look for patterns and reuse when actually sometimes we just need to solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my notes I have &amp;ldquo;People come to conferences for answers, when they should be remembering to use their brains&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; I assume that&amp;rsquo;s a quote from him, and not a comment I thought of at the time, but I wholeheartedly agree with it - if a shiny new technology solved your problems, you&amp;rsquo;d be out of a job.&amp;nbsp; Your job is to take the problem and figure out how to solve it.&amp;nbsp; Not to drag and drop an answer into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another talk that I can&amp;rsquo;t do justice to, watch the video when it comes online.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;…and finally….&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;At the end of the day, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.atlassian.com/&#34;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored community night was awesome.&amp;nbsp; I got to chat to (be prepared for gratuitous name dropping here) &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;; my old friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.simonbrown.je/&#34;&gt;Simon Brown&lt;/a&gt;; my ubiquitous &lt;a href=&#34;http://londonjavacommunity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/karianna&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jr0cket.co.uk/2012/03/qcon-london-2012-aftermath-return-of.html&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://zeroturnaround.com/&#34;&gt;Zero Turnaround&lt;/a&gt; guys; a couple of ex-colleagues from Evolution / Detica; a heap of LMAX and ex-LMAX guys; and, of course, bundles and bundles of new interesting people.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary (i.e the short version for those who can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to read this whole post)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s wishful thinking, but the messages I took from QCon were:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pASVscBgNZY/T3F3V-wBbuI/AAAAAAAAJlM/K8VlKf0FjLM/s1600/2012-03-07+17.49.55.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34;

width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to solve the problem your business has, you might want to model your system around their world.&amp;nbsp; Funny, that sounds suspiciously like Domain Driven Design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synchronous is bad, mmmkay?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hardcore understanding of what the computer is really doing seems to be coming back into fashion.&amp;nbsp; Hmmm, I wonder who started that…? (tongue firmly in cheek, we can&amp;rsquo;t have been the only ones)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t tune something you don&amp;rsquo;t understand&amp;rdquo; - testing and monitoring is kinda important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our business is all about trade offs.&amp;nbsp; There is no perfect solution, they pay us because it&amp;rsquo;s very very hard to work out something that&amp;rsquo;s Good Enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ultimately it feels like back to basics: understand the problem; model the domain, and have sympathy for the hardware that&amp;rsquo;s running your solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Corporate Bit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;QCon overall turned out to be a bit of an LMAX fest in the end, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://bad-concurrency.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Andy Stewart (our Chief Lord Business Analyst), all giving presentations there as well as me.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be on home turf, and it&amp;rsquo;s very cool to see that we have such a range of things to talk about that so many of us are invited to speak.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;PS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I just found out there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconnewyork.com/&#34;&gt;QCon in New York&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; My invitation seems to have got lost in the post.&amp;nbsp; Don&amp;rsquo;t suppose anyone wants me to speak there…?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>QCon: TODO list inspired by the conference</title>

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Things I took out of QCon:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul type=&#34;disc&#34;&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I want to play with &lt;st1:city w:st=&#34;on&#34;&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&#34;on&#34;&gt;Ajax&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Maybe      I&#39;ve &#34;grown out&#34; of front end development but that doesn&#39;t      prevent it from being (potentially) extremely cool&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://opensource.thoughtworks.com/projects/selenium.html&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt;      looks like a good place to start for automated website testing&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;It can take up to 7 years      to move away from a legacy architecture.&amp;nbsp; Depressing, but at least it      shows it can be done and it&#39;s worth the effort&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I&#39;m going to become a      &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scrumalliance.org/CSM_description/&#34;&gt;certified Scrum &lt;s&gt;Master&lt;/s&gt; Mistress&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I believe &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&#34;&gt;Agile      &lt;/a&gt;in some form or other is the most efficient way to run software      development, but there are a &lt;st1:place w:st=&#34;on&#34;&gt;LOT&lt;/st1:place&gt; of      lessons to learn in order to get it right.&amp;nbsp; And number one lesson is      you need the right team.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>QCon London</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week saw the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/conference/&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt; conference, an event &amp;ldquo;designed with the technical depth and enterprise focus of interest to technical team leads, architects, and project managers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference consisted of two days of tutorials followed by three days of talks covering technologies, vendor products, and processes.  In addition there were numerous &amp;ldquo;networking&amp;rdquo; opportunities with plenty of break times to both absorb information and meet other people, plus evening events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference was both comprehensive and absorbing, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to take the next few days to filter through the notes I have taken and present a more succinct version here.  Whether it will be of use to anyone other than myself remains to be seen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
